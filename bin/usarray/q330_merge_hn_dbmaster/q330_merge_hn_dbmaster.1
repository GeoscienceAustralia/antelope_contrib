.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBq330_merge_hn_dbmaster\fP is designed to merge q330 broadband and strong motion data with different filter types.
The q330 allows for different types of filters on broadband and strong motion channels.  Some
configurations which happen in real life include using acausal filters on broadband
sensors and causal filters on strong motion channels.

This program was written to address specific issues at the ANF for the USArray TA.
To build proper metadata for q330s using both causal and acausal filters, there is a 
multiple step process.

.nr step 1 1
.IP \\n[step]) 3
create one dbbuild batch file for the bb sensor and one dbbuild batch file for the sm sensor
.IP \\n+[step])
run \fBdbbuild\fP on both batch files creating two different dbs, \fIsm_db\fP and \fIbb_db\fP
.IP \\n+[step])
run \fBq330_merge_hn_dbmaster\fP \fIbb_db\fP \fIsm_db\fP

\fBq330_merge_hn_dbmaster\fP will merge the relevant parts of the \fIsm_db\fP into \fIbb_db\fP. 

.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP \fIbb_db\fP 
broadband database previously created with \fBdbbuild\fP.
.IP \fIsm_db\fP 
strong motion database previously created with \fBdbbuild\fP.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP -v

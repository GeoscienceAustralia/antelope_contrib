.TH CHECK_Q330PF_DB 1
.SH NAME
check_q330pf_db \- flag mismatch between open records in database and dataloggers in q3302orb.pf files
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fBcheck_q330pf_db \fP [-l] [-m \fImailto\fP] [-p \fIpf\fP] [-v] -m [\fImailto\fP] [-s \fIsubset\fP]  db
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBcheck_q330pf_db\fP reviews the dataloggers section of \fBq3302orb\fP parameter files 
and compares stations found there to a database to make sure that all open stations 
are in the pf files and that no closed stations are attempting to be collected.  
Optionally, it also checks to see if there are stations attempting to be collected 
that have not had any waveform data written to the database recently. 
.LP
This script may not see much use for any network other than the USArray Transportable Array. 
It was written to help alert the network operator of potential mismatches when trying to
keep track of the status of 450+ dataloggers who only reside in place for ~18 months.  With
25 or more dataloggers either installed or removed per month, a safety net to highlight
problems is necessary.  For static networks this script is unlikely to be run more than a 
few times per year, if at all.  Note that for the first released version of this script, 
there is the assumption that all dataloggers in the network are q330s.
 
.SH OPTIONS
.IP -l
Optionally review wfdisc for recent data.  See the \fImaxlag\fP and \fIchansub\fP parameters  
in the PARAMETER FILE.
.IP "-m mail_list"
Generate an automated email informing the \fImail_list\fP of the results of the checks.  
The recipient list should be comma separated. 
.IP "-p parameter_file"
Parameter file to use.  The default parameter file name is \fBcheck_q330pf_db\fP.
.IP "-s subset_expression"
Subset expression to be applied to site-snet join.  Overrides the \fIsubset\fP found in 
the PARAMETER FILE.
.IP -v
Verbose output.
.IP -V
Very verbose output.  Should only be used for debugging.
.IP db
Database which contains site and snetsta tables as well as optionally the sitechan
and wfdisc tables.  This argument is required.

.SH FILES
See \fBq3302orb(1)\fP for a full description of the q3302orb.pf file.  This script only
reviews the \fIdataloggers\fP section of that parameter file.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
Need to have sourced $ANTELOPE/setup.csh and environment variable $PFPATH set.
.SH PARAMETER FILE
Below is the default \fBcheck_q330pf_db\fP parameter file.

.IP \fIq3302orb_pfs\fP 
List of q3302orb parameter files to check.  Most networks only operate a 
single instance of q3302orb and use the default naming convention for that
parameter file so there would only be one item listed:  q3302orb.  However,
at the ANF in San Diego, for the TA project, we have 6 or 7 instances of 
q3302orb running, each with its own parameter file.  Shown here is an
example of a multi-q3302orb instance setup.

.IP \fIsubset\fP
A full expression for what subset needs to be done.  This subset can use
fields from the site and/or snetsta table.  Note that this subset is only
applied to the database, your list of dataloggers will not be subsetted in
a similar way.  See BUGS AND CAVEATS below.

.IP \fImaxlag\fP
Value is in days.  The wfdisc from the input database \fIdbin\fP is reviewed 
for stations that have no data more recent than now - maxlag (days).  Only 
used with the \fI-l\fP option.

.IP \fIchansub\fP
Channels to look for in the wfdisc table.  Subset applied to the wfdisc is
chan=~/\fIchansub\fP/.   Only used with the \fI-l\fP option.

.SH EXAMPLE

.in 2c
.ft CW
.nf
check_q330pf_db -l -m someone@somewhere.edu "snet=='TA'" db/usarray
.fi
.ft R
.LP
The above example applies all checks to the database.  User someone, might receive
an email with a subject of:  "Problems - check_q330pf_db hostname /datalag/".  It 
would be up to the user to then review their system to see if the station that is 
reporting the datalag is a station with comms issues and not sending data, or is
a station that has been extracted from the field and thus needs to be closed in 
both the metadata and removed from the q3302orb.pf file.

.in
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
There are three types of tests performed and if any one of the three tests are failed
they are reported in the subject line of the output email, or to STDERR.  The three 
possible failures that could show up individually, or in combination in the mail 
subject line are:  /datalag/, /excess db stations/, or  /rm q3302orb stations/.  
They are explained below.

.IP \fIdatalag\fP
Will only be returned if \fI-l\fP option is used.  This test is tripped if there are
dataloggers listed in the pf file with open records in the metadata, but no recent (see
\fImaxlag\fP) data.

.IP "\fIexcess db stations\fP"
If there are open stations in the database that are not found in the q3302orb pf files, 
this alarm is tripped.  It could be a non-issue for you if the station does not have 
a q330 (see BUGS and CAVEATS below), or it could indicate that you need to update your
metadata.

.IP "\fIrm q3302orb stations\fP"
If there are stations that have been closed in the metadata, but not removed from the
q3302orb pf files, this alarm is tripped.  For a mobile network like the USArray TA, 
this is an important case to trip because if the datalogger is reinstalled, it could 
start collecting data tagged with an incorrect station name.  A quick response to 
this alarm is recommended.

.LP
In a perfect world, no mismatches will be found and you will see a subject line 
that reports a \fISuccess\fP.

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
.LP
This program assumes all stations to be collected are q330s.  At some point, 
I need to put in a check to try to ignore a station if it is not using a q330
as the datalogger.

.LP 
Note that there is no check in this script to see if the sta-datalogger_sn 
reported in the database matches the sta-datalogger_sn recorded in the q3302orb.pf

.LP
If you use a \fIsubset\fP like \fI-s snet=='TA'&&sta=~/1.*/\fP, you may see many 
error messages like:

.in 2c
.ft CW
.nf

XXXX exists in a pf but is not found in the db 

.fi
.ft R
.in

This is because you subsetted the database only.  The same subset is not
applied to the dataloggers table so you may see many reports of a station
existing in the pf but not the db.

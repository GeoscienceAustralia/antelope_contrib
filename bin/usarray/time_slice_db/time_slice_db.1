.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBtime_slice_db\fP is designed to build periodic databases from a larger database.
The allowed periods of division are by month, by year or by day.
\fBtime_slice_db\fP will keep all data from the current month (or year or day), and the 
previous number of \fIlag_periods\fP in \fIdbin\fP.  
Older data will be split from \fIdbin\fP into monthly (or yearly or daily) databases.
\fBtime_slice_db\fP will reorganize the seismic database tables into the appropriate database 
directory structure - 
.IP \fIdirectory_base/YYYY_MM/dbbase_name_YYYY_MM\fP.  
.IP \fIdirectory_base/YYYY/dbbase_name_YYYY\fP.  
.IP \fIdirectory_base/YYYY_DDD/dbbase_name_YYYY_DDD\fP.  

.in
The decision for which db to include data is decided by the origin.time of the preferred origin for an event.  Even if other 
origins for the same event or associated arrivals cross over a time boundary, it is the preferred 
origin.time which controls the choice of db.

This program was written to address specific issues at the ANF for the USArray TA.  
It is designed to split up events including the following tables: 
event origin assoc arrival origerr stamag netmag emodel predarr.  It will also split up
the wfdisc, with the addition of the next day following the end of the output db so that 
events which have origin times at the end of the period can still be reviewed with the 
appropriate waveforms.  \fBtime_slice_db\fP will not move the actual waveforms 
(unless the \fI-f\fP option is used), it only
puts the correct references to where \fIdbin\fP waveforms are located.  If this program 
does not meet your needs, you should use  \fBdbsplit(1)\fP.

In the case of USArray TA, the command line used is:

.nf
time_slice_db -C -B -E -m flvernon@ucsd.edu $DB
.fi

which cleans up the input db, slices the big tables and the event related tables, but does
not touch the wfdisc and waveforms.  The USArray TA waveforms are dealt with using a 
combination of \fIrsync\fP, \fImonthly_wfs\fP, and \fIrtdbclean\fP.

This program con be configured to work on a live real-time database.  

.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "(-B | -E | -W)"
program requires one or \fBmore\fP of -E -B -W options
.IP \fIdbin\fP 
database which needs to be sliced.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP -v
verbose
.IP -V
Extremely verbose.  Used for debugging purposes only.
.IP -C
Clean up input database and rows which have been moved to the output databases. 
Before the cleanup is begun, the input database is saved into the \fIlast_saved_db\fP directory using 
\fIdbcp -s dbin last_saved_db\fP. Previous versions of the last_saved_db are overwritten.
.IP -s
Don't  attempt  to  keep  external file references correct; just copy the tables, 
and don't update dir/dfile fields. See dbcp(1).
.IP -f 
Actually copies waveforms instead of referencing original waveforms. See dbcp(1).
.IP -B
Only slices big tables listed in pf file. Can be used with -E and/or -W options.
.IP -E
Only slices events. Can be used with -B and/or -W options.
.IP -W
Only slices waveforms. Can be used with -E and/or -B options.
.IP "-p parameter_file"
Name of parameter file to use.  $PFPATH is searched to find parameter file.
The default parameter file is \fBtime_slice_db\fP.
.IP "-t start_time"
Start time for processing data.
The default start time is \fB1 January 1970\fP.
.IP "-e end_time"
End time for processing data.
The default end time is \fBnow()\fP.
.IP "-m mail_to"
email address list to send results.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
Need environment variable $PFPATH to be set.  Can be run under rtexec(1).
.SH PARAMETER FILE

.IP dirbase
directory base name for building the event and big_table databases
.IP wfbase
directory base name for building the waveform databases
.IP dbbase
base name for building database names
.IP period
Period of time for database segmentation.  Can be "year", "month", or "day".
.IP lag
Number of complete periods before present to allow to be processed.
If lag is 1 in arrears, \fBtime_slice_db\fP skips the current and immediately previous periods.
.IP dbidserver
Name of idserver to be written into descriptor file for output database to use.
.IP dbpath
dbpath to be written into descriptor file for output database to use.
.IP dblocks
dblocking type for database
.IP big_tables 
Table list of large database tables which require less strict (ie time consuming) processing

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
This program does most the work using perl system calls to the Datascope interface.
This was done because of the memory usage in large databases which could not be really
freed in perl.  Using system calls keeps the memory usage at a managable level even for
megarow databases.

.SH NAME
kfgrid \- compute an amplitude map in wavenumber-frequency space
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "kfgrid tstart slen sr kmax nk fmax nf kneg channame arrayname whiten dbname dir dfile"
.SH DESCRIPTION
Program kfgrid computes amplitude in wavenumber-frequency space for a linear 
array of channels. It works with an existing database to get the station 
parameters.  It works entirely in the time domain, finding the maximum amplitude
of the beam trace for all values of the 2-D wavenumber-frequency space.  Narrow-
band filtering is done to limit the frequency.   Iterating over frequency and
wavenumber, the program beams the signals and finds the maximum on the beam.  
The maximum value is inserted into the k-f map.  It writes the 2-D grid to a 
data file, as referenced in the fkgrid table of the database.  The grids are 
written as binary IEEE floating-point numbers ("u4" datatype in Antelope for 
Intel machines).

The following input parameters are used:

tstart = start time of signal in epoch seconds

slen = signal length to be beamed in seconds

sr = desired sampling rate (<= actual sampling rate).  This increases performance when looking at low-frequency signals relative to original sampling rate.

kmax = maximum slowness (s/km).  (This will be used to define minimum slowness as kmin = -kmax.

nk = # of slownesses from kmin to kmax.  (This should usually be an odd integer so that 0 Hz falls on (kmax - kmin)/(nk - 1).  This defines the number of columns in the map.

fmax = maximum frequency (Hz).

nf = # of frequencies from 0 to fmax.  This defines the number of rows in the map.

kneg = flag to compte negative k part of grid or not (1 = compute; 0 = do not).

channame = channel name to be assigned to F-K grid  (maximum of 8 characters). arrayname and channame should be a unique pair of grid identifiers.

arrayname = name of array (This name is arbitrary, but it must exist as a filename with suffix ".arr".  For instance, if "ZZZ.arr" is the file, then "ZZZ" is arrayname.  The maximum number of characters is 6.)

whiten = flag to whiten the spectrum across frequencies (0 = no whitening; 1 = whiten such that peak over wavenumber for each frequency = 1.0).

dbname = database name

dir = directory to hold output dfile.

dfile = file name to hold computed power in wavenumber-frequency space.

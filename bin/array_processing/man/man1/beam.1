beam \- form an array beam trace
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "beam tstart slen filter sr beamslow beamaz ampfunc beamtype delaytype channame arrayname refsta dbin dbout dir dfile"
.SH DESCRIPTION
Program beam computes an array beam trace. It works with an existing database 
to get the station parameters and creates a data file which is referenced in 
the wfdisc table of the database.  The beam is written as binary IEEE 
floating-point numbers ("u4" datatype in Antelope for Intel machines).  
A single beam is written to a given data file.  The option is provided to make 
simple delay-and-sum beams, N-th root beams, or incoherent beams.

The following input parameters are used:

tstart = start time of signal in epoch seconds

slen = signal length to be beamed in seconds

filter = filter specification in BRTT syntax, like "BW 0.5 4 8.0 4" (Must be put in quotes.)

sr = desired sampling rate (<= actual sampling rate).  This increases performance when looking at low-frequency signals relative to original sampling rate.

beamslow = beam slowness (s/km)

beamaz = azimuth to which beam is directed (incoming signal azimuth) in degrees CW from north
.nf

ampfunc = flag to select how amplitude is computed from beam
            1 = simple peak value (absolute)
            2 = average of absolute values in beam window (L1)
            3 = root-mean-square of values in beam window (L2)

beamtype = type of beam to be formed in slowness space
            1 = linear
            2 = 2nd root
            3 = 3rd root
            4 = 4th root
            5 = incoherent

.fi
delaytype = 0 means use delays in .arr file in addition to geometry delays; delaytype = 1 means the .arr file delays are the complete delays to apply

channame = channel name to be assigned to beam trace (maximum of 8 characters).  arrayname and channame should be a unique pair of trace identifiers.

arrayname = name of array (This name is arbitrary, but it must exist as a filename with suffix ".arr".  For instance, if "ZZZ.arr" is the file, then "ZZZ" is arrayname.  The maximum number of characters is 6.)

refsta = station which will be the reference point (x,y = 0,0).  (This station is arbitrary, but it must exist in the site table of the database.  Normally, this station is near the center of the array.)

dbin = database name of input data

dbout = database name of output data (beam traces)

dir = directory in which dfile will be put

dfile = name of beam waveform file.  This file will be written in the current directory.

.SH NAME
delay \- compute the inter-sensor distances and azimuths for an array
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "delay arrayname dbname"
.SH DESCRIPTION
Program distaz computes distances and azimuths among stations in an array.  The program 
works with an existing database to get the station parameters and creates two data files:one for the inter-station distances and a second for the inter-station azimuths.

The program assumes that the array covers a small enough area that Cartesian geometry 
applies.  Thus back azimuths are equal to azimuths plus 180 degrees.

The following input parameters are used:

arrayname = name of array (This name is arbitrary, but it must exist as a filename with suffix ".arr".  For instance, if "ZZZ.arr" is the file, then "ZZZ" is arrayname.  The maximum number of characters is 6.)

dbname = database name (the prefix used for the database)

A typical array file would contain only station names and would look like:

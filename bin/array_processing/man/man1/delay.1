.SH NAME
delay \- compute the time delays at an array for a given slowness vector
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "delay slowness azimuth delaytype arrayname refsta dbname dfile"
.SH DESCRIPTION
Program delay computes the delay times at an array of stations associated with 
a given slowness vector.  Geometrical delays, assuming the stations lie on 
a flat earth, are computed.  An option is provided to add known station delays
(that is, station effects) to the computed geometrical delays to get the optimum
delays for beaming.  An array file (see below) is input to provide the exact
stations for which delays are desired.  The program works with an existing 
database to get the station parameters and creates a data file of the delays.  
This data file can be used as an array file, for instance in the program "beam" (see man page for "beam"). 

The following input parameters are used:

slowness = slowness of wave (s/km)

azimuth = back azimuth of wave, as seen by array (degrees clockwise from north)

delaytype = type of delays to compute.  If equal to 0, compute the delays based
solely on array and incoming wave geometry.  If equal to 1, add known station 
delays to the geometrical delays.

arrayname = name of array (This name is arbitrary, but it must exist as a filename with suffix ".arr".  For instance, if "ZZZ.arr" is the file, then "ZZZ" is arrayname.  The maximum number of characters is 6.)

refsta = station which will be the reference point (x,y = 0,0).  (This station is arbitrary, but it must exist in the site table of the database.  Normally, this station is near the center of the array.)

dbname = database name (the prefix used for the database)

dfile = file name to hold computed array response

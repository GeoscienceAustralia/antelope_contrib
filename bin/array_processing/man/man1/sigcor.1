.SH NAME
sigcor \- correlate signals among channels of an array
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "sigcor tstart siglen laglen filter sr sigslow sigaz arrayname refsta dbname dfile"
.SH DESCRIPTION
Program sigcor correlates the traces of an array.  Every trace is correlated 
with every other one.   It works with an existing database to get the station 
parameters.  It creates a file with 3 ASCII tables: 1) interstation distances 
(km), 2) inter-station azimuth (degrees clockwise from north), 3) the 
correlation coefficients (-1 < r <= 1).  A correlation coefficient of exactly
-1 indicates that data was unavailable for either one or the other of the 
stations in a pair. 

The following input parameters are used:

tstart = start time of signal in epoch seconds

siglen = signal length to be sigcored in seconds

laglen = lag length to be used in seconds for cross-correlation

filter = filter specification in BRTT syntax, like "BW 0.5 4 8.0 4" (Must be put in quotes.)

sr = desired sampling rate (<= actual sampling rate).  This increases performance when looking at low-frequency signals relative to original sampling rate.

sigslow = sigcor slowness (s/km)

sigaz = azimuth to which sigcor is directed (incoming signal azimuth) in degrees CW from north

arrayname = name of array (This name is arbitrary, but it must exist as a filename with suffix ".arr".  For instance, if "ZZZ.arr" is the file, then "ZZZ" is arrayname.  The maximum number of characters is 6.)

refsta = station which will be the reference point (x,y = 0,0).  (This station is arbitrary, but it must exist in the site table of the database.  Normally, this station is near the center of the array.)

dbname = database name of input data.

dfile = name of sigcor output file.  This file will be written in the current directory.

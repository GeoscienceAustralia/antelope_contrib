.SH NAME
funcgen \- synthesize analytic and random test waveforms
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "funcgen type tstart width nfactor sta chan time samprate nsamp database dir filename"
.SH DESCRIPTION
Program funcgen generates various synthetic waveforms for testing purposes.
The output waveforms are written to a Datascope database.  They are written as 
binary IEEE floating-point numbers ("u4" datatype in Antelope for Intel 
machines).  

The following input parameters are used:

  type = type of function to be generated
         "zeros"  means entire trace will be exact zeros
         "delta"  means a 1-point delta function will be inserted at the toff
                  point of the trace
         "boxcar" means that a boxcar-shape will start at toff and have
                  width seconds and be 0's elsewhere
         "triangle" means that a triangle-shape will start at toff and
                  have width seconds and be 0's elsewhere
         "sine"   means a 1/width Hz sine wave will be created
         "impulse" means a f = 1/width Hz and h = 0.7 seismometer response pulse
                  will be generated and started at tstart
         "noise"  means a white-noise sequence drawn from a normal density with
                  zero mean and unit standard deviation will be created
  toff = offset (s), relative to time, at which synthetic wave starts
  width = width (s) of boxcar or triangle, or natural period in case of impulse
  nfactor = for adding random noise to any type (except "xeros" or "noise")
            This factor is the ratio of rms of additive noise to peak of signal.
  sta = station name
  chan = channel name
  time = epoch time of start of trace
  samprate = sample rate (#/second) of trace
  nsamp = # of samples in trace
  database = database name for output data
  dir = directory in which to write trace
  dfile = filename of trace

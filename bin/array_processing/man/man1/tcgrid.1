.SH NAME
tcgrid \- compute an amplitude map in period-velocity space
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "tcgrid tstart slen sr tmax nt cmax nc channame arrayname whiten dbname dir dfile"
.SH DESCRIPTION
Program tcgrid computes amplitude in period-velocity space for a linear 
array of channels. It works with an existing database to get the station 
parameters.  It works entirely in the time domain, finding the maximum amplitude
of the beam trace for all values of the 2-D period-velocity space.  Narrow-
band filtering is done to limit the frequency.   Iterating over velocity and
period, the program beams the signals and finds the maximum on the beam.  The
maximum value is inserted into the t-c map.  It writes the 2-D grid to a data 
file, as referenced in the fkgrid table of the database.  The grids are written
as binary IEEE floating-point numbers ("u4" datatype in Antelope for Intel 
machines).

The following input parameters are used:

tstart = start time of signal in epoch seconds

slen = signal length to be beamed in seconds

sr = desired sampling rate (<= actual sampling rate).  This increases performance when looking at low-frequency signals relative to original sampling rate.

tmax = maximum period (seconds).

nt = # of periods from 0 to t max.  This defines the number of columns in the map.

cmax = maximum phase velocity (km/s)

nc = # of phase velocities from 0 to cmax.  This defines the number of rows in the map.

channame = channel name to be assigned to F-K grid  (maximum of 8 characters). arrayname and channame should be a unique pair of grid identifiers.

arrayname = name of array (This name is arbitrary, but it must exist as a filename with suffix ".arr".  For instance, if "ZZZ.arr" is the file, then "ZZZ" is arrayname.  The maximum number of characters is 6.)

whiten = flag to whiten the spectrum across period (0 = no whitening; 1 = whiten such that peak over phase velocity for each period = 1.0).

dbname = database name

dir = directory to hold output dfile.

dfile = file name to hold computed power in period-velocity space.

.SH NAME
arf \- compute an array response pattern in 2-D slowness space for a given frequency
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "arf freq kmax nk arrayname refsta dbname dir dfile"
.SH DESCRIPTION
Program arf computes the 2-D array response in slowness space for a given 
frequency.  It works with an existing database to get the station parameters
and creates a data file which is referenced in the fkgrid table of the 
database.  The grid is written as binary IEEE floating-point numbers ("u4"
datatype for Intel machines).  Multiple grids can be written to a given data 
file, with corresponding offsets recorded in the fkgrid table.

The following input parameters are used:

freq = frequency at which array response is computed (Hz)

kmax = maximum slowness in s/km

nk = number of increments in slowness from -kmax to kmax (should be a odd integer to ensure slowness = 0 is (nk+1)/2 point)

arrayname = name of array (This name is arbitrary, but it must exist as a filename with suffix ".arr".  For instance, if "ZZZ.arr" is the file, then "ZZZ" is arrayname.  The maximum number of characters is 6.)

refsta = station which will be the reference point (x,y = 0,0).  (This station is arbitrary, but it must exist in the site table of the database.  Normally, this station is near the center of the array.)

dbname = database name (the prefix used for the database)

dir = directory in which dfile will be put

dfile = file name to hold computed array response

.SH NAME
kfresp \- compute a theoretical amplitude response map in wavenumber-frequency space for a linear or pseudo-linear array
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "kfresp sr kmax nk fmax nf kneg nl vel baz spacing channame arrayname refsta dbname dir dfile"
.SH DESCRIPTION
Program kfresp computes the theoretical amplitude response in 
wavenumber-frequency space for a linear array for an arrival at a given back
azimuth and velocity.  The array can be nominal, specified by a given spacing 
and number of elements.  In this case, the array is assumed to be inline with
the arrival.  Or the array can be a real array, given by the arrayname variable,
in which case, the spacings of the elements are computed along the vector of the
arrival by projecting the stations normal to that vector. In the latter case,
the program works with an existing database to get the station locations. 
It works entirely in the time domain, shifting pure sine waves and finding the 
maximum amplitude of the beam trace for all values in 2-D wavenumber-frequency 
space.  Iterating over frequency and wavenumber, the program beams the sine 
waves and finds the maximum on the beam.  The maximum value is inserted into 
the k-f map.  It then writes the 2-D grid to a data file, as referenced in the 
fkgrid table of the database.  The grids are written as binary IEEE 
floating-point numbers ("u4" datatype in Antelope for Intel machines).

The following input parameters are used:

sr = desired sampling rate.

kmax = maximum slowness (s/km).  (This will be used to define minimum slowness as kmin = -kmax.

nk = # of slownesses from kmin to kmax.  (This should usually be an odd integer so that 0 Hz falls on (kmax - kmin)/(nk - 1).  This defines the number of columns in the map.

fmax = maximum frequency (Hz).

nf = # of frequencies from 0 to fmax.  This defines the number of rows in the map.

kneg = flag to compte negative k part of grid or not (1 = compute; 0 = do not).

nl = number of stations in linear array (set = 0 for real array).

vel = velocity of assumed wave (km/s).

baz = back azimuth of assumed wave (degrees clockwise from north).  Setting nl > 0 causes a linear array, so baz is ignored.

spacing = for nl > 0, the inter-station distance in km if nl = 0 was entered, this is ignored.

channame = channel name to be assigned to F-K grid  (maximum of 8 characters). arrayname and channame should be a unique pair of grid identifiers.

arrayname = name of array (This name is arbitrary, but it must exist as a filename with suffix ".arr".  For instance, if "ZZZ.arr" is the file, then "ZZZ" is arrayname.  The maximum number of characters is 6.)

refsta = station code of reference station in array (must match one record in array file; not used if nl > 0, so enter a dummy name).

dbname = database name.

dir = directory to hold output dfile.

dfile = file name to hold computed power in wavenumber-frequency space.

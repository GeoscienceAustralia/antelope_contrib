This directory contains test cases for all the programs in ../bin.  A C-shell script
is provided for running the testcases.  Some of the test cases use synthetic data 
while others use data recorded from the 2008 North Korean nuclear explosion.

Several of the programs use an array file, with suffix "arr".  This ASCII file may 
contain several fields, but the first is always station name.  Other fields will depend
on the exact program, but include such things as channel name, static delay, or distance
along a linear array layout.

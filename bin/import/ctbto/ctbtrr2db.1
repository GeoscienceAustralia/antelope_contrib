.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBctbtrr2db\fP converts radionuclide reports from the International
Data Centre of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test ban Treaty Organization (www.ctbto.org)
into an antelop database in ctbto1.2 format. Acceptable input formats include ARR and RRR,
the different reports are saved to different tables according to the bulletin format.
Since the measured nuclides can differ, the nuclide details are stored in separate tables.
.SH OPTIONS

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
This script parses only the most basic information from the reports.
The reports can hold detailed information on gory details of everythin, which is completed ignored here.
.br
If no DATA_TYPE line is found, \fBctbtrr2db\fP assumes IMS1.0 format at the
first instance that it hits an EVENT line. \fBctbtrr2db\fP is a state-machine
that reads input lines successively from all supplied input files. If a
file after the first file does not have an explicitly specified DATA_TYPE,
the format (IMS1.0, IMS1.0:SHORT) will carry over from the
previous file.

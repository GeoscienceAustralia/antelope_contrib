.SH NAME
dbversac \- compare sac file headers with css database
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fBdbversac \fIdatabase\fR
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Occasionally, we create a css database with sac files 
containing the waveform data.  This means that various
parameter data is contained in both the sac headers and 
in the css database.  \fBDbversac\fR attempts to verify
that the parameters are the same in both places, since
it is easy to update the css database without changing the
sac headers.
.LP
This program is quite rigid, and depends on the existence of
the following tables:

.IP wfdisc
.IP sensor
.IP sitechan
.IP site
.IP wftag
.IP origin
.LP
The wftag table is expected to contain only entries joining
the origin and wfdisc table.  It expects that every wfdisc record
points to a sac file.
Provided all these conditions are met, the program checks that 
the following css database correspond with the sac headers
for each wfdisc record:

.IP calib
.IP foff
.IP nsamp 
.IP time
.IP endtime
.IP samprate
.IP segtype
.IP sta
.IP chan
.IP lat
.IP lon
.IP elev
.IP hang
.IP vang
.IP edepth
.IP "event time, lat, lon, depth"

dbversac requires a way of generating a wftag table.

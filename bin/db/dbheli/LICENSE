I offer this software with no promise of support.
It is a very old program originating from my
days at the University. I have only put this into
contrib at the request of many folks who wanted
to see it in the antelope releases. This source code 
is my ONLY contribution. Please modify it as much as 
you wish, but please don't send me e-mails asking questions -
I have long since recycled any memory associated with
this ancient program.

.TH DBMOMENT_RUN_EXAMPLE 1

.SH NAME
dbmoment_run_example \- run dbmoment on 2 example events

.SH SYNOPSIS
run_dbmoment_example [temp_path]

.SH DESCRIPTION
The Dreger's inversion source code is included in the contributed code
repo as well as 2 full examples from the original distribution.
The data needed for the example is located on folders "EXAMPLE_1" and
"EXAMPLE_2".

This test script will have a default value for the temporary test folder
or you can specify one at the command-line. The default value is in your
home folder.

Inversion will have the same limitations as the original Dreger's
code and users should be familiar with Dreger's documentation.


.SH ENVIRONMENT AND DEPENDENCIES
You need to have $ANTELOPE defined in your environment. Then
compile the source code.

    make clean;
    make;
    make install;

It will require write access to the example folder:

    $ANTELOPE/contrib/example/dbmoment/

.SH PARAMETER FILE
None.

.SH EXAMPLE
You can run the dbmoment code by hand from any directory.

For this you have 2 options. You can run without arguments and create a new
dbmoment_example folder on the working directory or you can specify one
argument for the base path to the dbmoment_example folder.

    dbmoment_run_example

    or

    dbmoment_run_example /Users/cooluser/dbmoment/

This will make the directory if missing and will run both examples.
You will see several new folders.

    .dbmoment       => Temp folder for calculations.
    synthetics_db   => Includes all databases for synthetics.
    dbmoment_images => Default folder to save the results in PNG files.


.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
The first example is set at time 0 so the final date will display as
"1/01/1970 0:00:00.0" on the results and the PDF image. This is a
consequence of not having an event time nor time for the seismic traces
on the original example from Dreger's distribution.

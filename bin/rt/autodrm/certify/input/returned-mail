   Users Guide for the Antelope AutoDRM Server.		
   ---------------------------------------------
    $Date: 2002/04/24 20:53:57 $ 

To obtain data from this autoDRM server, send electronic
mail to mail to the datacenter's autodrm request line, 
(usually "autodrm@datacenter").

The request e-mail contains commands starting in column one
which specify what data you want to receive.  By convention,
the keywords are written in upper case below, but the server
understands any mix of upper and lower case.

* The first line must start with : BEGIN
* The last line starts with      : STOP

The return address is taken by default from the mail header; however,
you can specify the return address explicitly with the e-mail command:
    
    E-MAIL  return-address

This autoDRM server does not support an ftp interface for large requests;
all requests are returned via email.  If the result is too large, you
may get an error return instead.  Multi-part email responses are not
supported.

Responses follow the GSE2.1 format.  Please refer to the following document
for more information:

GSE2.1
    http://www.seismo.ethz.ch/home/autodrm_news.html


The following commands are supported:
=============================================================

BEGIN Version-id                       First line in a request.  The version-id
				       is ignored.

MSG_TYPE request                       Second line of a GSE2.1 request (optional)

MSG_ID message_id source_id            Third line of a GSE2.1 request message, (optional)
				       The message_ID may be up to 20
				       characters long.  This
				       message_id and the source_id
				       will appear as the reference_id
				       (REF_ID) in the response!  The
				       souce_id's are specified in the
				       GSE2.0 documentation (max. 
				       7chars) This line is optional
				       on *this* AutoDRM but not at
				       others (as e.g.  the GSETT-3
				       IDC).

E-MAIL email@return-address            E-Mail address where response should be sent.

TIME [StartDateTime] TO [EndDateTime]  Definition of Start- and End-DateTime for request.
                                       Times should conform to a format like: 
						"1994/02/24 16:23:50.20"

STA_LIST ABC [,D*] [,HIJK]             Stations desired 

CHAN_LIST SHZ [,SHN] [,SLZ]            Channels desired

WAVEFORM                               Get waveforms for specified Time/Channels

WAVEF stn                              Similar to command WAVEFORM GSE2.0,
                                       but no STA_LIST is required (station
                                       stn' is defined on the command line).
                                       Valid station names may be obtained using
                                       the command SLIST (see there).
                                       Multiple lines with this command (for 
                                       additional stations) are allowed. This 
                                       command must be preceeded by either the 
                                       command TIME or the commands DATE1 and 
                                       DATE2.

STATION                                Get station-info for specified stations

CHANNEL                                Get channel-info for specified channels

RESPONSE                               Get response-data (calibration) of the
                                       specified stations/channels


OUTAGE                                 Get outage-info on specified channels

STOP                                   This must be the last line of any request

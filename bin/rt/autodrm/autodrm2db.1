.TH AUTODRM2DB 1 
.SH NAME
autodrm2db \- convert autoDRM responses to a database
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
autodrm2db [-vV] input-file [file ..] database
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
autodrm2db attempts to read autoDRM responses and 
create or update a database with the contents.  
The waveforms are not converted to a different input
type, but rather the corresponding wfdisc row refers 
to the input autodrm response directly.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP -v
Be verbose
.IP -V
Be extremely verbose.

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
The resulting database may differ depending on the order of the
information in the autoDRM response.  Generally, it's good
to get channel and site information, then response information, 
and finally waveform data.
.LP
autodrm2db will not resolve any conflicts found.
.LP
There are multiple output formats for different autodrm
servers and versions.  
Different servers follow different 
conventions and have different restrictions on the format and
order of the input requests.  Similarly, different servers
may depart from the "standard" set of reply formats.
.LP
autodrm2db cannot accommodate all these differences, but should 
probably be more tolerant than it is.
.LP
autodrm2db does not handle CONTINUED/CONTINUATION replies.
The best way to handle these is to concatenate the different replies
together and delete everything between CONTINUED and CONTINUATION
lines.

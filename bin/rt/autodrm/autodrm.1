autodrm \- Antelope IDC/GSE2.1 AutoDRM Server
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBautodrm \fP[-dv] [-D \fIdir\fP] [-p \fIpf\fP] [\fIfiles\fP]
.SH DESCRIPTION
An AutoDRM is an email based system (with an optional ftp facility)
for requesting and obtaining data, particularly seismic data.
The specification originated at ETH in Switzerland.  For more information,

Quoting from that document:
.in 2c

\fIAn AutoDRM (Automatic Data Request Manager) is a software package,
that allows anyone with access to electronic mail to retrieve data
from the site where such an AutoDRM is installed.\fP

\fIAutoDRM is now a widely used method to retrieve earthquake information
(including waveform data) from seismological observatories.  Besides
the original 'standard' most AutoDRMs today understand requests in the
so-called GSE2.0 format and their response mails are also in this
format.  The GSE2.0 format was developed by members of the GSE (Group
of Scientific Experts at the Conference on disarmament),
representatives of the FDSN (Federation on Digital Seismographic
Networks), and representatives of the U.S.  Geological Survey.\fP

.in
.LP
As part of the verification of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty,
the original AutoDRM protocol and definition was considerably extended
to provide a method for obtaining data from participating stations.
The Antelope \fBautodrm\fP implements a subset of this new extended
protocol.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP -d
This debug option prints the output on stderr, rather than sending mail
to the requester.
.IP "-D directory"
Run in the specified \fIdirectory\fP, rather than in the home directory
of the destination user (typically \fBautodrm\fP).
.IP "-p pf"
Use the specified parameter file, rather than \fBautodrm\fP.\fIpf\fP.
.SH Setting up a new autoDRM server
.IP \(bu
Create the autodrm user.  Copy autodrm_wrapper into the home
directory.
Setup the .forward file for this
user using the supplied prototypes forward and autodrm_wrapper.
.IP \(bu
Verify that mail is delivered properly by using autodrm_wrapper to
direct it to a file first.  Verify that the ANTELOPE environment
is set up properly.  Typical problems at this stage are directories
along the path to the home directory which have group write permission,
bad ownership or permissions of .forward or autodrm_wrapper.
.IP \(bu
Copy autodrm.pf to the autodrm user home directory, and edit appropriately.
.IP \(bu
Use try_autodrm(1) to send a test request to the server.
Correct any problems which appear.
.SH PARAMETER FILE
.IP observatory
name of the institution and its location
.IP source_code
See the GSE documentation
(e.g., pp 10 of Provisional GSE2.1 Formats and Protocols)
to learn how to specify this.
This should be something like a 3-letter country code,
followed by _ and a 3 letter
abbreviation of the organization (NDC is reserved), e.g. \fIUSA_BRT\fP.
.IP return_address
the return address for mail from \fBautodrm\fP
.IP operator
trouble mail is sent to this address
.IP database_for_requests
This is the Datascope database from which to pluck data for replies
.IP error-log
error-log is a log of errors; generally mail is also sent to operator.
.IP max_email_size
maximum size of email request-response in bytes.
.IP minimum_free_space
When free space in the \fBautodrm\fP directory falls below this limit
(in k-bytes), mail is sent to the operator.  This is intended to help
prevent server failures.
.IP ftp-directory
This is not used currently; in the future it should indicate an
ftp directory where requests that are too big for email can be left.
.IP max_ftp_size
This is not used currently: it will be the
maximum allowed size of ftp request-response
.IP max_ftp_spool_size
This is not currently used, but will provide another means of
limiting output ftp responses.
.IP max_ftp_latency
This is not currently used; \fBautodrm\fP will use it
to periodically clean out the ftp directory
.IP incoming_replies_directory
directory into which to save replies from other autoDRM's; these
are recognized by the presence of \fIDATA_TYPE\fP or \fIMSG_TYPE DATA\fP
lines in the request.
.IP incoming_program
program to run on incoming autoDRM replies: autodrm2db(1) is one
choice.  This program is run with two arguments: a file containing
the incoming reply, and a database name from \fIincoming_database\fP
below.
.IP incoming_database
database into which to save incoming autoDRM data; this is used
as the second argument to the \fIincoming_program\fP.
.IP no_bulletin
Bulletins may only be provided by some sites.  Station autoDRM's
do not have adequate information to locate events, for example.
Set this parameter to some message to prevent attempts to create
a bulletin.
.IP bulletin_title
This is a title for bulletin responses, and may include
epoch2str(3) '%' expansions to create a date.
.IP bulletin_types
The autoDRM standard allows setting up multiple bulletin types,
which for \fBautodrm\fP must correspond to different databases.
This list allows setting up a correspondence between the
bulletin type and the database.
.IP restrict_bulletin_origins
The standard database may very well include associated
origins from other bulletins, and it may be desirable to
not include these in the \fBautodrm\fP bulletin.  This
expression is used to subset the join of event and origin
used to create a bulletin.
.IP allow
.IP deny
Choose to fill out either the allow or deny lists with regular
expressions.  If allow is not empty, only addresses in the allow
list are accepted (but addresses which match a pattern in the deny
list are still rejected).  This is used first to reject returned mail,
and secondly to allow restricting access to the server.
.IP log_database
.IP log_schema
\fBautodrm\fP keeps a database of requests and replies.
.IP reply_preface
This header prefaces all responses to AutoDRM requests.
.IP help_msg
This file is sent in response to a help message.
.IP reply_id_format
Each reply is required to have a unique id, which \fBautodrm\fP
constructs using the time and date.  You may (cautiously) change this.
See epoch2str(3) for codes; the id May not include '/' characters,
and must be less than 25 characters,
.IP reply_id_timezone
Specify UTC to use GMT time, or leave blank to use the local time
for the reply_id.
.IP save_requests
if this is non-zero, save all incoming requests in the directory \fIrequests\fP
by reply_id.
.IP save_replies
if this is non-zero, save all outgoing replies in the directory \fIreplies\fP
by reply_id.
.IP request_expiration_age
requests older than this number of days are automatically removed.
.IP reply_expiration_age
replies older than this number of days are automatically removed.
.IP default_bulletin_type
fill this in if there's more than one bulletin available
.IP examples
When an input request has an error, \fBautodrm\fP attempts to provide
a correctly formatted example request from this list.
.IP maximum_waveform_period
maximum amount of data to allow in a request
.IP maximum_outage_period
maximum period over which to allow a request for outages.
.IP Network
network code; may be dictated by the \fBautodrm\fP standard.
.IP reference_coordinate_system
This is used in many of the \fBautodrm\fP responses, but is not part of the
CSS 3.0 database.

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
.IP \(bu
Does not implement multi-part replies.
.IP \(bu
Does not implement subscribe requests.
.IP \(bu
Is not compulsive about input correctness.
.IP \(bu
The Provisional GSE2.1 Formats and Protocols specifies that
.sp
\fIA GSE message without a STOP line
is considered incomplete and is ignored.\fP
.sp
This specification is ignored.
.IP \(bu
The \fIdata delayed\fP message for waveforms is not implemented.
.IP \(bu
The time environment is neither required nor optional for the
station and channel requests, but both are sometimes time dependent.
This server uses the time environment if present, and otherwise
provides only station and channel information for the last 24 hours.
Similarly, the response information is provided only for the last 24
hours unless an explicit time range is requested.
.IP \(bu
The station reply includes a \fIstatype\fP field which is supposed
to take the values \fI1C\fP, \fI3C\fP, \fIhfa\fP or \fIlpa\fP.
This implementation
uses the statype field from the site table, which likely has different
values by default.
.IP \(bu
The response reply requires a stage and calibration table (rather
than just a sensor and instrument table).
.IP \(bu
Because autoDRM wants to put a network code into waveforms, the
foreignkeys database may need to have anetsta and achanaux filled in
for all the station/channel pairs in the \fBautodrm\fP database.
.IP \(bu
The IDC AutoDRM specification
lists the allowed instrument types, but the existing database may use
other codes.
.IP \(bu
The network environment variable is short-circuited to allow only
a single network.  That is, if any network is specified, it must
be the network in the parameter file, otherwise no data is available.
The server cannot support multiple networks.
.IP \(bu
The specification requires a reference coordinate system in
the station and channel and waveform results.  For station
and channel, this implementation uses the coordinate system
specified in the parameter file; for waveforms, the coordinate
system is obtained from the trdefaults(5) parameter file.
.IP \(bu
Because the autoDRM network code is different from the CSS net
code, the current version doesn't allow serving multiple networks
from a single autoDRM server.
.IP \(bu
autoDRM specifies a restricted set of instype values.  The database
must be constructed to contain only the approved values; \fBautodrm\fP
does no checking to verify that this is the case.

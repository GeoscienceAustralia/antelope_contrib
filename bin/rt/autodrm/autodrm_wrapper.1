.SH SYNOPSIS

autodrm_wrapper

.SH DESCRIPTION
This script is used to set up the environment properly so that
autodrm will run.  It is typically run by sendmail as a result of
a .forward file.  Sendmail setups differ, so it may be necessary to 
edit this script a bit.

.fi
.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
Permissions are extremely important; most
recent versions of sendmail will refuse to use a .forward file if
any user other than the email recipient can write to the .forward
file or any of the directories on the path to that file.

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBnagios_check_q330_ping\fP is intended to be used as a plugin to
the Nagios network monitoring system (www.nagios.org). The plugin can
be installed with other plugins (usually in the Nagios libexec
directory or $ANTELOPE/bin) and called through the Nagios
configuration files. 

This program sends off a series of QDP PING packets to a Quanterra Q330
unit. It then returns the percent of packet loss from the ping set.

.SH OPTIONS
.nf
Like all Nagios plugins, more detailed and recent help, argument
formats, etc. can be obtained via the -h option of the program.

This version includes support for Nagios-style ranges for warning
and critical thresholds. According the the Nagios documentation, this
is as follows:

[@]start:end

Notes:
\- start > end>
\- start and ":" is not required if start=0
\- if range is of format "start:" and end is not specified,
   assume end is infinity
\- to specify negative infinity, use "~"
\- alert is raised if metric is outside start and end range
   (inclusive of endpoints)
\- if range starts with "@", then alert if inside this range
   (inclusive of endpoints)

Critical and warning thresholds refer to packet loss from the ping sequence.

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
Due to what appears to be a bug somewhere in Perl 5.8.0 on Linux (and
possibly other platforms), this program does not build correct packets and
is thereby ignored by the Q330. Since Antelope 4.7 ships on Linux with
5.8.0, this software needs to use a different (system?) version of Perl to
be functional. Perl 5.8.4 (possibly earlier versions as well) seems to
have corrected the bug and this program behaves normally.

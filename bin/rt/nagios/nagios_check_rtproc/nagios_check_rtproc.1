.SH NAME
nagios_check_rtproc \- a Nagios plugin to monitor the status of an rtexec-managed process
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fBnagios_check_rtproc\fP [\fB\-i \fI[1|true]\fP] [\fB\-w \fI<warn>\fP]
     [\fB\-c \fI<crit>\fP] \fB<RT system path>\fP \fB<RT system process name>\fP
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBnagios_check_orblag\fP determines if a process run under Antelope rtexec is
currently running.  The plugin queries the rtsys database in an Antelope
 real-time system directory.

It is intended to be used as a plugin to the Nagios network monitoring system
(www.nagios.org). The plugin can be installed with other plugins (usually in
the Nagios libexec directory) and called through the Nagios configuration files.

Since it requires direct access to the real-time system configuration, this
script has to be run on the same host as the real-time system in question. Thus,
it is recommended that this probe is used in conjunction with NRPE or similar so
that it can be executed remotely from a central monitoring box.

Warnings will be returned if process has been restarted by rtexec.

The default thresholds are as follows:

State       # of restarts
-----       -------------
Warning     2
Alarm       5
Critical    10

.SH OPTIONS
.nf
Like all Nagios plugins, more detailed and recent help, argument
formats, etc. can be obtained via the \fB\-h\fP option of the program.

The warning thresholds can be customized as follows.

  \fB\-i, --ignore \fI[1|true]\fP
  Ignore process restart warnings.

  \fB\-w, --warn\fP
   Customize the 'Warning' threshold. [Positive Integer]

  \fB\-a, --alarm\fP
   Customize the 'Alarm' threshold. [Positive Integer]

  \fB\-c, --critical\fP
  Customize the 'Critical' threshold. [Positive Integer]

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"

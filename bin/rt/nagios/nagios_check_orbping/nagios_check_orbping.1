.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBnagios_check_orbping\fP is intended to be used as a plugin to the
Nagios network monitoring system (www.nagios.org). The plugin can be
installed with other plugins (usually in the Nagios libexec directory)
and called through the Nagios configuration files. The plugin queries
the specified orbserver orb using the orb ping command, and reports the
round-trip time of the ping in seconds plus the server version of the
orbserver.
Used in combination with APAN or another tool, this plugin could be
used for performance measurements and/or graphing.
.SH OPTIONS
.nf
Like all Nagios plugins, more detailed and recent help, argument
formats, etc. can be obtained via the -h option of the program.

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
If you are using custom orb names, you will need to make sure that Antelope has
an updated orbserver_names.pf on the monitoring host that matches that on the
system to be checked, or use a numeric port identifier.

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBorbampmag\fP is a program that continuously looks for parameter file
packets (/pf/\fItorbmag\fP) on an ORB and computes magnitude whenever a packet
is read. The input parameter file packets are produced by orbassoc(1).
The magnitude is written back to the ORB as a modified
\fI/db/origin\fP packet. Optionally, \fI/db/netmag\fP and
\fI/db/stamag\fP packets may also be written.
It is intended to compute mb, ML or Ms.
Each different magnitude has to be computed in a different instance of \fBorbampmag\fP,
which requires different parameter files for each magnitude.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "-v"
verbose flag
.IP "-start {pktid|time|OLDEST|NEWEST}"
Where to start in the ORB that contains the origin packets.
This argument is optional.
If this is not specified, then the start will be at the
next newest packet.
.IP "-number number"
How many origin packets to process. This argument is optional.
If this is not specified, then there will be no limit on
the \fInumber\fP of origin packets processed.
.IP "-nowait"
If this is specified, then \fBorbampmag\fP will exit when
the ORB read pointer gets to the most recent packet. If
not specified, then \fBorbampmag\fP will wait for new packets
to arrive indefinitely.
.IP "-state statefile"
A file for storing start/stop state information.
This argument is optional.
.IP "-pf parameter_file"
Name of program parameter file. This argument is optional.
The actual parameter file name is \fIparameter_file\fP.pf.
The default value of \fIparameter_file\fP is \fBorbampmag\fP.
.IP "-auth_expr auth_expr"
Datascope expression for matching the input author field.
This argument is optional and if not specified, then
the default is \fIorbassoc\fP.
The \fIauth\fP field in all input origin packets is
tested against this expression and if it does NOT match,
then the origin is not processed. Whenever \fBorbampmag\fP
successfully processes an origin, it appends \fImag\fP
onto the \fIauth\fP field before it writes it out.
It is important to set \fIauth_expr\fP so that origin rows
that are written by \fBorbampmag\fP are not re-processed
endlessly.
.IP "-target_orbmag torbmag"
A target name for this instance of \fBorbampmag\fP. Input parameter
file packets will be selected based upon this name.
The name should match the \fBorbampmag\fP target name specified
in orbassoc(1). The default is "orbmag".
These packets are created by \fBorbassoc\fP or \fBorb2dbt\fP and may be modified by various
instances of \fBorbampmag\fP.
.IP "-next_target_orbmag torbmag"
A target file for the next instance of \fBorbampmag\fP. This enables
the independent computation of mb,ML,Ms in different instances of
\fBorbampmag\fP. See the example below how to run \fBorbmag\fP and \fBorbampmag\fP together.
.IP "-make_magtables"
If this is set, then the netmag and stamag table rows
will be created and written as ORB packets. Otherwise,
by default, no netmag or stamag rows are created.
.IP "-use_mean"
If this is set, then mean and standard deviation statistics are
used in the network magnitude averages. Otherwise, by
default, median and quartile statistics are used in the
network magnitude averages.
.IP "-use_p2p"
If this is set, then the amplitude is computed as peak2peak/2,
wherever the minimum and maximum amplitude appear in the trace.
By default, the absolute maximum is used.
.IP "{-use_if_not_associated|-use_if_not_defining}"
If -use_if_not_associated is set, then all stations in the
\fBorbampmag\fP parameter file are used regardless if they were
detected and associated with each origin.
If -use_if_not_defining is set, then only stations in the
\fBorbampmag\fP parameter file that are detected and associated with
each origin are used, including stations that are associated
but are not "defining" in the location.
If neither option is set, then, by default, only stations
in the \fBorbampmag\fP parameter file that are detected, associated
and are "defining" in the location for each origin are used.
.IP "orbwf"
The input orb that will contain all of the waveform data.
This argument is required.
.IP "orbdb"
The input/output orb that will contain all of the database rows.
\fI/db/origin\fP packets are read and modified \fI/db/origin\fP
packets are written.
This argument is required.
.IP "dbname"
The name of the database that contains site and instrument
information. The tables used are \fIsite\fP, \fIsensor\fP,
\fIinstrument\fP, and \fIcalibration\fP.
.SH PARAMETER FILE
The \fBorbampmag\fP parameter file must contain a table, named "mag",
that defines a list of all network_stations to be used
for processing magnitude values. An example \fBorbampmag\fP

The parameters are defined below.
.IP maxwaittime
This is a hard timeout value that is applied to waveform packet reading.
There are situations where all of the channels for processing, for
a particular event, may be dead or otherwise missing in the waveform
ORB. When this happens, the waveform packet reading loop can block
indefinitely waiting for packets to process. This timeout value
prevents such situations.
If no waveform packets for the selected channels are received
within this time period, then the waveform reading loop is
interrupted and any further processing for that event is
aborted.
.IP magtype
Specifies the magnitude to compute. Currently supported values are 
\fImb\fP,\fIml\fP and \fIms\fP. Depending on the choice here, 
other parameters have to be specified accordingly.
.IP v_r
Surface wave velocity to determine surface wave arrival time. 
Only needed when computing \fIMs\fP.
.IP "time0, time_window_factor,minimum_time_window"
The time window for processing waveforms is determined from 
\fItime0\fP and \fItime_window_factor\fP. The processing window is 
\fBcentered\fP around the theoretical arrival time of the onset 
specified by \fItime0\fP and has a width of (S-time - P-time) * \fItime_window_factor\fP.
The time specified by \fIminimum_time_window\fP allows to mitigate the case when S and P are close together.
.IP "mindelta, maxdelta"
These values in degrees define the distance region for magnitude computations.
Only stations where the distance from the origin falls into the region defined here are taken into account.
.IP "c0, c1, c2, c3, c4, c5" 
define whatever you might find appropriate to compute your magnitudes.
The formula actually used for magnitude computation is the following:
c0+log10(amp)+c1*log10(delta)+c2*log10(delta*c3+c4)+c5
.br
the units for amp are nanometers while the units for delta are degrees
.IP filter
Defines the filter applied to the data.
.IP sta
The sta parameter identifies the css3.0 station code.
.IP chan_expr
This is a regular UNIX expression that is matched against the
actual css3.0 data chan codes. If a match occurs, then the data channel is used.
.IP calib_from_db
If set to yes (or true or 1) then the \fIcalib\fP value for
converting counts to ground velocity (or displacement) is obtained
from the database calibration table. Otherwise, \fIcalib\fP is obtained directly
from the wfdisc row entries.
.IP decon_instr
If set to yes (or true or 1) then the instrument response
is deconvolved. Otherwise, the instrument response
is not deconvolved.
.IP apply_wa_filter
If set to yes (or true or 1) then the Wood-Anderson filter
is applied. Otherwise, the Wood-Anderson filter
is not applied.
.IP snr_thresh
This is a signal to noise threshold value. The noise for each
waveform preceding the initial P arrival is computed as a
root mean square. If the observed peak value (the signal)
of the event divided by the noise value is less than snr_thresh,
then the magnitude is not computed for the particular channel.
.IP twin_noise
This determines the time window for computing
the noise in front of the first P-arrival. 
If this is set to \fB0.0\fP or negative, then a noise estimate is not 
computed and the signal-to-noise testing is
not done. If this is set to a floating number greater than 0.0, then
that value is used as a noise time window in seconds.
.IP latency
A maximum latency value in seconds for waiting for out
of time order data packets. There is also a latency value
for the entire group of channels. The most recent packet time
for all of the channels is stored. If the difference between
this most recent time and the requested end time of a particular
data channel is greater than the group latency, then the
particular channel is processed and cleared.
.IP "minclip maxclip"
These are optional clip limits that are applied to the raw waveform data
before applying \fIcalib\fP or any filtering. These should be specified in
units of counts. If any of the channels for a particular station exceed
either clip limit across either the noise or signal time windows, then
the station is not used in the magnitude calculation. If these are not specified,
then the data is not checked for clipping. 
.LP
Applying instrument deconvolution can cause instabilities. For
broadband instruments, it is usually not necessary to apply
instrument deconvolution since the instrument response
is flat in the response band of the Wood-Anderson filter.
In cases where the instrument is a narrow band short period
at 1 Hertz, it is usually not necessary to apply either
the deconvolution or the Wood-Anderson filter. In all cases
the responses are converted to displacement and the correct
gains are applied to produce equivalent Wood-Anderson
drum recorder displacement.
.SH EXAMPLES
This is how I call \fBorbampmag\fP 3 times in rtexec.pf
to compute more or less independent of each other mb,ml,ms.
.LP
orbassoc puts out the default \fI/pf/orbmag\fP packets which are read to compute mb.
This instance then puts \fI/pf/orbml\fP, which is read by another instance that computs ml, etc...
Obviously, the last instance puts nothing back. This calling order allows for 
rapid alerting on mb/ml even when the waveforms required for Ms computation 
have not yet arrived at the stations.

This example shows how to run both \fBorbampmag\fP and \fBorbmag\fP together. \fBOrbmag\fP must be called last, as it does not hand over the modified \fI/pf/orbmag\fP packets.

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
\fBorbampmag/dbampmag\fP uses the predicted P arrival based on the IASPEI91
model to define the time windows for processing.  \fBorbampmag/dbampmag\fP does
not use the P and S arrivals from the arrival table.
.br
Instrument response deconvolution is not supported at this time.
Acceleration sensor channels are not supported at this time.
.br
The program should have been named velocityampmag. Instead of deriving displacement amplitudes, the program directly uses velocity amplitudes to compute the respective magnitudes. This of course requires the conversion of the "normal" formulas into the velocity regime.
.SH "DIFFERENCE FROM DBML / ORBMAG"
While \fBdbml/orbmag\fP only compute Richter magnitudes, \fBdbampmag/orbampmag\fP allow the computation of mb,ml and ms. 
.br
The curent versions of \fBorbmag/dbml\fP allows the magnitude computation based on previous mesurements stored in the database table wfmeas. This feature is NOT supported by \fBdbampmag/orbampmag\fP.
.br
In \fBdbml/orbmag\fP, the starttime for waveform processing is defined 
by the \fItime0\fP parameter, while in \fBdbampmag/orbampmag\fP this 
parameter defines the center of the processing window.
.br
While \fBdbml/orbmag\fP allow to set the parameter \fItwin_noise\fP 
to \fItproc\fP, this is not supported by \fBdbampmag/orbampmag\fP.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
The default parameter files mb.pf,ml.pf and ms.pf contain values 
used for the computation of \fImb\fP, \fIML\fP and \fIMs\fP by the author at ZAMG/Vienna.

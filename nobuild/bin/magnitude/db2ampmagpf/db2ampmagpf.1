.TH DB2AMPMAGPF 1 "$Date$"
.SH NAME
db2ampmagpf \- generate parameterfiles for \fBdbampmag\fP/\fBorbampmag\fP from dbmaster.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fBdb2ampmagpf\fP \fIdbname\fP
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBdb2ampmagpf\fP reads a database, and tries to guess the best channels for magnitude computation. It merges this information with the default parameterfiles for \fBdbampmag\fP/\fBorbampmag\fP and saves this as new parameter files in the current directory.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "dbname" 
Name of the database with station/channel information. At least the tables \fIsite\fP and \fIsensor\fP must be present. This argument is required.
.SH PARAMETER FILE
The program reads the default parameter files for \fBdbampmag\fP/\fBorbampmag\fP, mb.pf, ml.pf, ms.pf. 
To produce station parameters, it reads the 1st entry found there and replaces sta and chan_expr with the values found in the database specified on the commandline. 
.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
The program uses the information from in the default parameterfiles mb/ml/ms. You can adapt the defaults by modifying these files somewhere in your PFPATH.
.LP
The program assumes that for all station/channel combinations configured in the database waveforms are available.
.LP
The program uses the following mechanism to guess the \fIbest\fP channels for a given station.:
.LP
higher samplerates are preferred, e.g. HHZ is preferred over BHZ
.LP
Higher gain is preferred, e.g. HHZ is preferred over HLZ.
.LP
For body wave magnitudes, vertical components are preferred over horizontals, i.e. if there's HHZ, it will use that.
.LP
For other magnitudes, vertical components are preferred, i.e. it tries to use HH[NE] if available.
.LP
For channels with loc-codes, all selected components will have the same loc-code. If there is HHN_00 and HHE_01, only HHN_00 is used.

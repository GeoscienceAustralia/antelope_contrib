.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBsmartpick_classic\fP is the original graphical-user-interface driver 
for dbpick. It has been replaced by the entirely rewritten \fBsmartpick(1)\fP
application. The old version has been preserved under the name
\fBsmartpick_classic\fP so network operations are not forced to switch to 
the new version, though they should consider doing so. 

\fBsmartpick_classic\fP allows
button-driven control of the most common prompt-based navigation
commands to dbpick, plus several other common commands. A button to
launch dbe on the database being viewed is also included. Smartpick will
complain and die if no wfdisc table is present in the database. If a
trial database name is specified, the trial database is used to look up
association information for displaying picked traces. This is provided
for compatibility with dbloc2. If the trial database is not specified, the
default input database is used for looking up association information.
Most of the arguments are designed to allow \fBsmartpick_classic\fP to be used in 
conjunction with dbloc2 (see the example in the EXAMPLE section below).

\fBsmartpick_classic\fP expects a very particular and strict interpretation of the
network.nettype field, and the network and affiliation tables, in order
to build the full set of network menus. In addition to the "Station" menu, 
which allows one to focus on one particular station, there are five menus 
at lower left labelled 
.nf
	Array
	Processing Group
	Circuits
	Namespace Network
	Volcano
.fi
These buttons provide the ability to select networks of stations from the 
affiliation table and display all the stations in the chosen network. 
Instead of presenting all the networks of the network table in one list, 
these buttons divide the networks into the five listed categories, based
on the value of the network.nettype field. The accepted values for 
network.nettype are: 
.nf
	ar		(Array)
	pr		(Processing Group)
	cr		(Circuit)
	lo or ww	(Namespace)
	vo		(Volcano)
.fi
"Array" means a cluster of stations spaced closely enough together to 
take advantage of coherence in the wavefield. "Circuit" indicates 
a group of stations which all come in on the same telemetry channel (e.g. 
one radio link for multiplexed analog stations) or acquisition mechanism. 
"Volcano" indicates a cluster of stations all on a single
volcano. "Processing Group" is intended as a grab-bag for all other types 
of station groupings. Finally, there are actually two appropriate uses 
of the term "network": one use means a simple association of stations 
in some arbitrary category. The other use labels a 'namespace' in which a 
given station-name is unique. In the application for which \fBsmartpick_classic\fP 
was written, the network.nettype codes of "lo" and "ww" are used to 
identify the networks which are used as namespace identifiers--e.g. the 
SEED-code network names like "AK", "AZ", or "KN". Without this restriction,
the ambiguity of "network" in the CSS3.0 database causes difficulties. 

Note that both the station and network menus are tear-off menus, for 
convenience (just click on the dotted line at the top of the list). 

\fBsmartpick_classic\fP can compute and display spectra, or extract segments of waveform 
data, based on the waveforms shown in the window. It does this by 
subcontracting to the dbspgram(1) and trexcerpt(1) commands, respectively. 
In the case of the "spectrograms" button, only the first trace in dbpick's 
display list is used. Note that if you did a "Zoom" instead of a "Select" 
in dbpick, you won't get what you expected!! 

The parameter file specifies a table of default_phases. For each entry in the
list, a button will be created to "Set Default Phase" (invoking the "ph" command
on the dbpick(1) command line).
.SH OPTIONS
.IP -nowait
Bring up dbpick automatically upon startup
.IP -nostarttalk
Synomym for -nowait, done for ease of use with dbloc2
.IP "-appname window_name"
Argument \fIwindow_name\fP is passed to dbpick as the -appname option
.IP "-winfile winfile"
Argument is passed to dbpick as the -winfile option. If this option is
not specified, the default name "smartpick_classic_dbpick" is used, or a unique
name is generated if that file already exists.
.IP "-comout named_pile"
Argument is passed to dbpick as the -comout option.

.SH EXAMPLE
One may use \fBsmartpick_classic\fP in conjunction with dbloc2 by changing the dbpick 
launch-line in dbloc2.pf. For example, instead of 
.nf

dbpick          /usr/openwin/bin/xterm -geometry 80x24+0-0 -e dbpick -nostarttalk -winfile $Define{Work_dir}/dbpick_window -geom 1000x700 -appname dbloc_dbpick -comout $Define{Work_dir}/dbpick_pipe $Input_database

.fi
One would use 
.nf

dbpick          /usr/openwin/bin/xterm -iconic -e \fBsmartpick_classic\fP -nostarttalk -winfile $Define{Work_dir}/dbpick_window -appname dbloc_dbpick -comout $Define{Work_dir}/dbpick_pipe $Input_database $Trial_database

.fi
.SH FILES
.IP smartpick_classic_dbpick
default name of winfile created for dbpick, if one
is not specified on the command line. If one already exists, a unique name
will be generated. This file is removed upon normal exit.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.nf
smartpick(1), dbpick(1), dbe(1), dbloc2(1), dbspgram(1), trexcerpt(1)

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
\fBsmartpick_classic\fP is the old version of the completely rewritten
\fBsmartpick(1)\fP application. Users should consider switching to the 
latter, or kindly providing feedback to kent@lindquistconsulting.com 
on any shortcomings that prevent its adoption (the author cannot promise
changes will be made, however all feedback will be considered). 

This program was originally written for a specific application, 
and has been slowly generalized. Many parts of the internals should 
be rewritten, to remove prototype strategies, clean up the code, and 
replaces hacks with correct engineering. However, the program has been
popular enough and requested widely enough that it is being submitted on
an 'as-is' basis.  

Lingering winfiles from previous runs (e.g. smartpick_classic_dbpick) would
confuse some dbpick options in previous editions. Generation of
unique winfile names hopefully fixed this. If \fBsmartpick_classic\fP exits normally (i.e.
with the Quit button), it will clean up the winfile made by dbpick.

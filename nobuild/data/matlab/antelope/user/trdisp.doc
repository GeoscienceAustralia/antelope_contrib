TRDISP Simple display of trace object

TRDISP( TR, NMAX )

TRDISP takes a Datascope trace-object and displays it in a 
simple Matlab figure with sub-plots for each trace. This is intended 
for testing and for small data sets. NMAX gives the maximum number 
of traces to show (always the first rows listed in the trace-object)

DBCENTRAL_DBNAMES Retrieve database paths for a cluster in a dbcentral clusters table

DATA = DBCENTRAL_DBNAMES( DB, CLUSTERNAME, INCLUDE_TIMES, VERBOSE )

DBCENTRAL_DBNAMES takes a Datascope database path and clustername 
to a Datascope dbcentral clusters database table and returns a data 
structure containing all the wild-card expanded database filenames. 
It uses the 'volume' field to correctly resolve directory paths and 
filenames.

The DB and CLUSTERNAME arguments are required. 

INCLUDE_TIMES is an optional argument that will additionally return 
the epoch start time of each resolved database path and filename. 
The default integer value is 0. To return start times assign this 
variable the integer value 1.

VERBOSE is an optional command to print verbose output to assist in
troubleshooting. The default integer value is 0. To return verbose
output assign this variable the integer value 1.

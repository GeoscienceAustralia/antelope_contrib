TR_SAMP2TIME Calculate time of sample based on index

TIME1 = TR_SAMP2TIME ( TIME0, SAMPRATE, N_INDEXED_BY_1 )

TR_SAMP2TIME returns the sample time of a data sample at index 
N_INDEXED_BY_1, given the starting epoch time TIME0 and the
sample rate SAMPRATE of the data vector.

C Programmers WAKE UP:
TR_SAMP2TIME conforms to the Matlab indexing convention of starting
at 1, thus this interface differs from Antelope interfaces in other
languages which start at 0.

TRGETWF Read trace data from file into memory

[DATA, NSAMP, T0, T1] = TRGETWF ( DBPTR [, REQS, REQE] )

Given a single database record specified by DBPTR, TRGETWF
reads the specified time range of trace data into the array
DATA.  Because the times of individual samples or the span
of available data may not correspond exactly to the data in
the file, the actual number of samples NSAMP, and starttime T0
returned may differ from the requested times. The time samples
of the returned data vector satisfy T0 <= T < T1. In other words,
T1 is **not** the endtime of the data vector, rather the time 
of the next sample-point beyond the data vector. 
T0 and T1 are specified as epoch times. REQS and
REQE, the requested start and end times, may be specified
as epoch times or as time-strings decodable by str2epoch.
If REQS and REQE are omitted, or if REQS >= REQE, the entire
time range specified by the database row is returned.

TRFILTER apply time-domain filters to trace data

TRFILTER ( TRPTR, FILTER_STRING )

TRFILTER performs time-domain filtering on all of the traces 
in the input trace-object TRPTR. The filter is specified 
in the FILTER_STRING argument, as described by the Unix man-page
trfilter(3). For example, to apply a Butterworth Band-pass filter 
from 1 to 5 Hz with eight poles, the FILTER_STRING would be 
'BW 1 4 5 4'. For full details on FILTER_STRING options, please see 
the referenced man page. The data arrays are filtered in place 
so that original sample values are replaced with the new filtered values.

TRNEW	Create a new trace database

TR = TRNEW ( [ PATH [, SCHEMA_NAME ] ] )

TRNEW creates a new trace database. If PATH is specified, 
the database is created under the pathname PATH. Otherwise
the database is created in /tmp, with a name like 
trdbXXXXXX, where XXXXXX is an integer (following the 
conventions of mktemp(3)). If SCHEMA_NAME is specified, 
the database is created under the named schema. Otherwise
the 'Trace4.0' schema is used. The PATH must be explicitly
specified in order to specify a SCHEMA_NAME other than the 
default.

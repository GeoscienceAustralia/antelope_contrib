TRWFNAME Generate external file names

PATH = TRWFNAME ( DB [, PATTERN] )

TRWFNAME provides a mechanism for generating the names of external
files, stored outside an Antelope database. Although originally 
designed for files of seismic waveforms, the utility is applicable
generally. The database-pointer DB should refer to a table with 
dir and dfile fields, and should point to the row for which 
a file is to be added. The row should be filled in with all
necessary information before calling TRWFNAME. The PATTERN is 
a string, a combination of plain characters interspersed with '%'
signs which introduce either an epoch2str(3) code for 
introducing time elements into the pathname, or a '%{field}' to
take fields from the specified database record. For more detail 
on the time fields see the documentation for the EPOCH2STR command. 
The complete path is returned. If this path does not exist, 
TRWFNAME will create it. If PATTERN is omitted, TRWFNAME uses 
the default pattern 

	"%Y/%j/%{sta}.%{chan}.%Y:%j:%H:%M:%S"

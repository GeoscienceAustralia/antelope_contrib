TR_TIME2SAMP Calculate the index of a data point based on its time

N_INDEXED_BY_1 = TR_TIME2SAMP ( TIME0, SAMPRATE, TIME1 )

TR_TIME2SAMP returns the sample index of a data sample at TIME1,
given the starting epoch time TIME0 and the sample rate SAMPRATE 
of the data vector.

C Programmers WAKE UP:
TR_TIME2SAMP conforms to the Matlab indexing convention of starting
at 1, thus this interface differs from Antelope interfaces in other
languages which start at 0.

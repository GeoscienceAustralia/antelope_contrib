TRLOAD_CSSGRP Load waveform data from grouped CSS database into trace table

TRPTR = TRLOAD_CSSGRP ( DBPTR, TIME, ENDTIME [, TRPTR] [, TABLE] )

TRLOAD_CSSGRP is quite similar to TRLOAD_CSS, but expects to be passed
a db pointer which has already been sorted by station, channel, time.
In addition,  it  may  interpret  this pointer  as  a bundle pointer,
with db.record specifying the first record, and db.field specifying the
last  record.   If db.field is dbALL, then all records from the
specified table are used.

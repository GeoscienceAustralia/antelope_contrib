TRLOAD_CSS Load waveform data from CSS database into trace table

TRPTR = TRLOAD_CSS ( DBPTR, TIME, ENDTIME [, TRPTR] [, TABLE] )

TRLOAD_CSS takes as input a view DBPTR which includes
pointers to waveform records. It selects from this view
waveform sections which fall in the range TIME to ENDTIME,
reading them into memory and adding new rows in the trace
table TRPTR. If TRPTR.database is < 0, a new trace database
is created, and the records are added into the new trace
table in that database. if TRPTR is not specified, a new
trace database is automatically created. Because the input
is a view which may contain multiple tables with dir/dfile
fields, the component TABLE which contains the waveforms
may be specifically indicated; if TABLE is zero, the
default is wfdisc.  Note that if TIME and ENDTIME are
character strings, they will be evaluated as expressions on
the input table DBPTR, so the time range may be, for
example, a complex function of station, channel, and event,
or a simple time expression enclosed in quotes.

TRINSERT_DATA Put data from a Matlab matrix into a trace-object

TRINSERT_DATA ( TRPTR, DATA )

TRINSERT_DATA puts a copy of data from the Matlab array DATA
into the single database-row of a trace object specified by 
TRPTR. The user is responsible for making sure the trace-object
row does not already contain data from another operation. 
TRINSERT_DATA sets the nsamp field of the trace-database row; 
however, the user is responsible for other fields such as 
time, samprate, etc.

TRROTATE_TO_STANDARD rotate three-component trace data to standard coordinates

TRROTATE_TO_STANDARD ( TRPTR, NEWCHANS )

TRROTATE_TO_STANDARD takes all traces pointed to by a trace-object TRPTR
and rotates them to a standard coordinate system, i.e. standard
geographical coordinates comonly used in seismology where the first
coordinate (X1) is positive to the East, the second (X2) is positive
North, and the third (X3) is positive upward. NEWCHANS is a
three-element cell-array of strings, such as {'BHE','BHN','BHZ'},
specifying the channel-names of the newly rotated components.  The
TRROTATE_TO_STANDARD command is a direct link to the underlying C-library
rotate_to_standard(3) command, including the return codes of that
routine. There are a number of important caveats in using this routine.
Therefore, if problems are encountered, one should consult the Unix man
page for rotate_to_standard(3). Among these concerns is the necessity
to call TRAPPLY_CALIB before calling TRROTATE_TO_STANDARD on real data.
Also see the command TRROTATE.

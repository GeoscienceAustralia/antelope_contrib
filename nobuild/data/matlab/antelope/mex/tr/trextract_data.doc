TREXTRACT_DATA Read data from a trace object into a Matlab matrix

DATA = TREXTRACT_DATA ( TRPTR )

Given a single database record specified by TRPTR, TREXTRACT_DATA
reads the corresponding data into a Matlab array. This does
not free the user from the obligation of freeing the tr
structure when it is no longer needed.

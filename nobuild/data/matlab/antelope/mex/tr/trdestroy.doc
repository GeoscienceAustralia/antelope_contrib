TRDESTROY free up memory buffers and tables for Datascope trace object

TRDESTROY ( TRPTR )

TRDESTROY frees up the memory buffers and clears the trace
object tables for a Datascope trace object pointed to by
TRPTR. The user should be careful not to attempt any further 
operations on a trace-object that has been freed. Note
that despite the name, the trace object is currently not an
Object in the Matlab sense.

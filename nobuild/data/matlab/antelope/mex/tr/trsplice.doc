TRSPLICE splice together data segments

TRSPLICE ( TRPTR, TOLERANCE )

TRSPLICE attempts to splice together data segments to form a
single  array.  When  this is successful, it eliminates gaps
which may have arisen because the data was segmented as part
of  the  recording  process, and also eliminates overlapping
segments which may have been created during recording.
However, it may not be possible to splice  two  segments  if
(for  example)  an  actual  gap  exists, or if there is some
irregularity with the sampling rate, or the  sampling  combs
appear  not  to match. TOLERANCE is the percentage of a time 
period by which  adjacent segments may differ and still be
spliced together.

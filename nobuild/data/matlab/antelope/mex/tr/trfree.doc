TRFREE free up memory for part of a trace object

TRFREE ( TRPTR )

TRFREE frees up the memory buffers and clears the trace
object tables for the part of a Datascope trace object 
pointed to by TRPTR. For example, if TRPTR points to 
a single row, the resources for that row will be freed and
the row will be marked for deletion. If the TRPTR has the
table set to dbALL, TRFREE acts like TRDESTROY, removing
all the resources for the entire trace object. Note that
despite the name, the trace object is currently not an 
Object in the Matlab sense. The user should be careful 
not to perform any further options on a freed trace 
object.

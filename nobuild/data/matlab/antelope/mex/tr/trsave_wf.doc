TRSAVE_WF Save trace-object waveform data to a new database

TRSAVE_WF ( TRPTR, DBPTR, DATATYPE, WFNAME, ['overwrite' | 'append' ] )

TRSAVE_WF saves waveform data from a trace object TRPTR to
the specified database table DBPTR (usually wfdisc).
Datatype may be specified as any type in the waveform_type
table of trdefaults.pf, or this argument may be set to
zero.  In the former case, the data is saved to disk in the
specified format; in the latter case, the data is saved in
the format specified by the datatype field in the trace
table.  In the event the datatype field is not specified in
the trace table, s4 floating point format is used.
Waveform names are generated according to the pattern
WFNAME, as described in trwfname(3).  Directories will be
created as needed (provided permissions allow this).
If the file to be written already exists, the default behavior
of trsave_wf is to fail with an error message. If the 'overwrite' 
flag is specified, the existing file will be overwritten. If 
the 'append' flag is specified, the existing file will be appended.

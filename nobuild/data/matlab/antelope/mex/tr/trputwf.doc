*********************** WARNING **********************

TRPUTWF saves waveform DATA into a file.  The input
database pointer DBPTR must point to a record in a wfdisc
table (or another table with the necessary fields). This
record should be completely filled out; in particular, the
fields nsamp, datatype, foff, and dir and dfile must be
specified. TRPUTWF uses this information to write the data
to the output file. The data is converted to the specified
output type (datatype), and written to the specified file
at the specified offset foff. Any header is not
overwritten, but the file is truncated following the
written data.  trputwf will attempt to create any necessary
directories which do not already exist.

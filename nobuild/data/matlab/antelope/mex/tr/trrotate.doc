TRROTATE three-component rotation of trace object

TRROTATE ( TRPTR, PHI, THETA, NEWCHANS )

TRROTATE rotates three-component traces of waveform data by the
specified angles PHI and THETA, translating the input 'E', 'N', and 'Z'
components (X1, X2, X3) into the three-component, right-handed
coordinate system specified by NEWCHANS. PHI is the azimuthal rotation
around the X3 axis in degrees (positive clockwise looking towards
negative X3). THETA is the rotation in the X1-X3 plane about the X2
axis (positive clockwise looking towards negative X2). NEWCHANS 
is a three-element cell-array of strings, such as {'BHR','BHT','BHZ'}, 
specifying the channel-names of the rotated E,N, and Z components. 
The TRROTATE command is a direct link to the underlying C-library
trrotate(3) command, including the return codes of that routine. There 
are a number of important caveats in using this routine. Therefore, 
if problems are encountered, one should consult the Unix man page 
for trrotate(3). Among these concerns is the necessity to call 
TRAPPLY_CALIB before calling TRROTATE on real data. Also see the 
routine TRROTATE_TO_STANDARD.

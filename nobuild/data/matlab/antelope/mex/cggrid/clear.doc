CGGRID/CLEAR	CGGRID elimination routine

CLEAR ( CGG )

CLEAR removes the computational-geometry grid specified by CGG.

The CGG argument is a link to a cggrid object in the underlying
Antelope libraries.  Although multiple copies of the matlab object may
be made, only one copy of the underlying cggrid object exists (unless
the CGGRID constructor is called repeatedly). The functional form

	CLEAR( CGG )
	
destroys the underlying object itself, freeing the memory used by the
Antelope libraries and unregistering the object (thereby preventing
it's further use via other references). If one merely wants to destroy
a reference to the CGGRID object, without removing or destroying the
underlying CGGRID itself, use the command form (No parentheses around
the argument):

	CLEAR CGG

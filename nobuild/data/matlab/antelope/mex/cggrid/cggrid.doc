CGGRID	Computational-geometry-grid class constructor

CGG = CGGRID ( FILE ) **or** CGGRID ( X, Y, Z )

CGGRID creates an object representing a computational-geometry-grid. 
This object may be generated from a pre-existing FILE by specifying 
the pathname of the file as a string input. A cggrid object may also be 
generated from three two-dimensional matrices specifying the X, Y, and Z 
values, respectively (in the style of the Matlab MESH command). X, Y, and 
Z must be regular meshes or grid-creation will fail.

CGGRID2DB	Save a Computational-Geometry grid to a Datascope database

CGGRID2DB ( CGG, DBPTR, RECIPE_NAME, GRID_NAME, OUTPUT_FILE, FMT, UNITS, QGRIDTYPE, AUTH, [, 'overwrite'] )

CGGRID2DB saves a computational-geometry grid CGG to a Datascope
database with the gme1.0 extensions.  The RECIPE_NAME, GRID_NAME,
OUTPUT_FILE, FMT, QGRIDTYPE, AUTH, and UNITS arguments should be
specified as strings.  The OUTPUT_FILE argument may be a pattern in the
style of TRWFNAME.  CGGRID2DB assumes the input database view,
specified with the DBPTR variable, contains an origin table from which
it can get an origin time and orid from the first row.  The FMT
argument gives the format in which to save the specified grid, for
example 'as' or 't4'. For allowed formats see the Unix man page
cggrid(5).

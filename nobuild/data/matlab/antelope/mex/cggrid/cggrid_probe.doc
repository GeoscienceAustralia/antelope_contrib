CGGRID_PROBE	Probe a CGGRID object for the data value at a given point

VAL = CGGRID_PROBE ( CGG, X, Y )

CGGRID_PROBE returns the data-value VAL from within a cggrid object
CGG, where X and Y are values of coordinates within the grid. If 
X and Y do not fall exactly on a grid point, bilinear interpolation is 
used to estimate the grid value at the test point. If X and Y are 
for a point outside the grid, CGGRID_PROBE returns NaN.

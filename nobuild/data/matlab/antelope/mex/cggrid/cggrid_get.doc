CGGRID_GET	Get an array of x,y,z triplets from a CGGRID object

[TRIPLETS, NX, NY] = CGGRID_GET ( CGG )

CGGRID_GET returns a two-dimensional (three column) array of
x,y,z TRIPLETS from the input computational-geometry
grid object CGG. The number of points in the x and y dimensions are 
returned as NX and NY, respectively.

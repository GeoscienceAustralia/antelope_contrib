ARRTIMES	Returns all calculated phases

[TIMES, PHASENAMES] = ARRTIMES ( DELTA, DEPTH )

ARRTIMES returns all seismic phase travel-times for the specified
epicentral distance DELTA in degrees and hypocentral DEPTH in km. 
Two vectors are returned, one with relative travel-times TIMES in seconds
and one with the corresponding phase names. The travel-time tables
are specified with the environment variable TAUP_PATH, defaulting to iasp91.

PARSEPATH	Parse a path into components

[DIR, BASE [, SUFFIX]] = PARSEPATH ( PATH )

PARSEPATH separates an input PATH into its components: a 
leading directory component DIR, a basename BASE, and, 
optionally, a SUFFIX. The directory defaults to "." when
there is no directory part. The separation of the SUFFIX
is not done if less than three output arguments are specified. 
No checking of actual entities on any filesystem is done, 
thus the resulting BASE may itself be a directory instead of 
a file, and PATH does not have to be a real filesystem location.

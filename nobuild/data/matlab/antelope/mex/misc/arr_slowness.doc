ARR_SLOWNESS	Returns all calculated phase slownesses

[SLOWNESS, PHASENAMES] = ARR_SLOWNESS ( DELTA, DEPTH )

ARR_SLOWNESS returns all seismic phase travel-time slownesses for the specified
epicentral distance DELTA in degrees and hypocentral DEPTH in km. 
Two vectors are returned, one with SLOWNESS values in sec/km
and one with the corresponding phase names. The travel-time tables
are specified with the environment variable TAUP_PATH, defaulting to iasp91.

DBLOOKUP Aim a database pointer at the specified table, field, record

DBPTR = DBLOOKUP ( DBPTR, DATABASE, TABLE, FIELD, RECORD )

DBLOOKUP is a means for translating  from  a  symbolic
name (the  name  of  a  database,  table,  field  or
record,  eg wfdisc.dir) to the integer id in the database
pointer.   You specify  an  input  database  pointer and
one or more names.  Names which are not specified
explicitly  in  the call  are represented by the null
string. For example, given a database pointer which
specifies a particular database, to find the database
pointer which specifies the 'dir' field in the 'wfdisc'
table, use the following:
	db = DBLOOKUP ( db, '', 'wfdisc', 'dir', '' ).
If the specified database is not found among the open
databases, dblookup will attempt to open it.
Since records have no corresponding names,  the
record_name parameter  is  not  very  useful.   However,
you can specify 'dbALL', 'dbSCRATCH' or 'dbNULL' in this
position.  Alternatively,  dblookup will search for the
first record for which the specified field has the
specified (string) value, starting with record zero.

DBEXTFILE Compose a filename from the specified Datascope database record

[FILENAME STATUS] = DBEXTFILE ( DBPTR, TABLENAME )

Given a database  pointer  specifying  a  row  in  a table,
and the base table name, DBEXTFILE gets the dir and dfile
from the row, and composes the file name by concatenating
the directory of the database table,  dir,  and  dfile.  It
also checks to see if the file exists, which it indicates
by the returned string STATUS.

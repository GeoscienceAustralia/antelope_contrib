DBFILENAME Compose a filename from the specified Datascope database record

[FILENAME STATUS] = DBFILENAME ( DBPTR )

Given a database  pointer  specifying  a  row  in  a
table, DBFILENAME gets the dir and dfile from the row, and
composes the file name by concatenating the directory of
the database table,  dir,  and  dfile.  It also checks to
see if the file exists, which it indicates by the returned
string STATUS.

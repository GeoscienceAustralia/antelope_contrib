DBFIND Locate a row satisfying some condition in a database

IRECORD = DBFIND ( DBPTR, EXPRESSION [,FIRST [,COUNT]] [,'backwards'] )

DBFIND looks for a row which matches the specified
EXPRESSION.  DBFIND searches backwards if the last argument
is the 'backwards' option. If FIRST is specified, DBFIND
starts the search from the specified record. Otherwise, the
search starts from record 0 for forwards searches and from
the last record for backwards searches.  If COUNT is not
specified, DBFIND returns the index of the first record it
finds. Otherwise it looks for the n'th matching record,
where n is given by COUNT. If COUNT is specified, FIRST
must be explicitly specified, even if you want the default
value of zero. If DBFIND does not find a record matching
the criteria, it returns an IRECORD of -102 (dbINVALID).

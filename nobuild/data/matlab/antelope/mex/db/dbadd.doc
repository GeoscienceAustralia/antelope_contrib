DBADD	Add a record to a Datascope database

RECORD_NUMBER = DBADD ( DBPTR, RECORD )

DBADD adds a new row to the table pointed to by DBPTR.  The
new record is taken from RECORD, or if RECORD is 'dbSCRATCH',
from the scratch record for that table.  (Thus the scratch
record may be used to build up a record before adding it to
a table).  DBADD returns the record-number of the added
record, equal to dbINVALID (<0) if an error occurred.

DBNEXTID Get the next integer id for the specified name from a database

ID = DBNEXTID ( DBPTR, IDNAME )

DBNEXTID returns the next available integer for  the
specified field name IDNAME. It looks up the current
value in the table, increments that by one, updates the
lastid table, and returns  the incremented value.  If no
entry is found in the table corresponding to the name, a
new entry is created, and its value set to one.  In the
event the specified field name is a Unique key  in  a
table  and no entry exists in lastid, that table is
searched and the next available id found. The lastid table
is updated appropriately.

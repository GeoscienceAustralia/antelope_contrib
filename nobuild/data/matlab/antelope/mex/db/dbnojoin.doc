DBNOJOIN Find records which do not join between two database tables

DBPTR = DBNOJOIN ( DBPTR1, DBPTR2 [, PATTERN1 [, PATTERN2]] )

DBNOJOIN returns a view composed of  all  the  records
from  the table specified with DBPTR1 which don't join with the
table specified with DBPTR2.  As with DBJOIN, the join keys may
be specified explicitly, or inferred from the schema.

If PATTERN1 and PATTERN2 are not specified, the join keys
between the tables are inferred. If PATTERN1 is specified, it
gives the join keys to use in both tables, presuming the 
named fields are present in both tables. If PATTERN1 and PATTERN2
are both specified, PATTERN1 specifies the DBPTR1 fields that should
match the corresponding fields in PATTERN2 for DBPTR2, respectively.
PATTERN1 and PATTERN2 are cell-arrays of strings.

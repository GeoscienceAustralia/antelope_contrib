DBADDV	Add values to a Datascope database

DBADDV ( DBPTR, FIELD, VALUE [,FIELD, VALUE ... ] )

DBADDV adds a new record to a plain table (not a view),
filling in the specified fields, just as DBPUTV does.
However, the new record is first filled with null  values,
and  the lddate  field  is  filled in after the values from
the call.  (Thus, if you pass  in  a  value  for  lddate,
it  will  be overwritten).  DBADDV checks to ensure that
the primary and  alternate  key for  the  record  are
completely  filled in (no null fields allowed, except for
offdate and endtime), and unique.   However,  you  may
leave out an id field that is a primary key, eg wfid in
wfdisc or arid in arrival, and the field will  be filled in
with the results from dbnextid.  If the record you
provide  is  not  unique,  ie,  there  is another record
with the same primary or alternate key in the table, the
table is not updated.  dbaddv goes on to  compare all  the
fields  in  the record.  If the all the fields are either
the same, or the new record has a  null  value,  then
dbaddv  returns the record number of the matching record.
If there is a discrepancy in some field of the matching
record, then dbaddv returns a negative value which is equal
to dbINVALID - matching_record_number - 1.  Dbaddv uses
the scratch record to hold the new record before adding
it  to  the  table,  so any previous contents of the record
are lost.

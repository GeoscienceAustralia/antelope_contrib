DBJOIN_KEYS Show inferred keys for joining two tables

DBPTR = DBJOIN_KEYS ( DBPTR1, DBPTR2 **or** DBPTR, TABLE1, TABLE2 )

Occasionally it is useful to know the inferred keys which will be
used to join two tables. DBJOIN_KEYS provides a cell array of strings
listing the join keys for two tables. The arguments are either 
two database pointers pointing to the two tables, or a database
pointer to the open database plus two string table-names.

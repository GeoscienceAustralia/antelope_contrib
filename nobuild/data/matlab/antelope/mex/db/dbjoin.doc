DBJOIN Join the specified Datascope database tables

DBPTR = DBJOIN ( DBPTR1, DBPTR2 [, PATTERN1 [, PATTERN2]] [, 'outer' ] )

DBJOIN joins two tables, specified by the database pointers
DBPTR1 and DBPTR2, of a Datascope Database. The result is
returned as another Database pointer, DBPTR.  Normally, for
some records in the first table, there may be no matching
record in the second table. This would normally mean that
there would be no corresponding record in the joined
table. Setting the 'outer' option forces an entry for every
record in the first table. 

If PATTERN1 and PATTERN2 are not specified, the join keys
between the tables are inferred. If PATTERN1 is specified, it
gives the join keys to use in both tables, presuming the 
named fields are present in both tables. If PATTERN1 and PATTERN2
are both specified, PATTERN1 specifies the DBPTR1 fields that should
match the corresponding fields in PATTERN2 for DBPTR2, respectively.
PATTERN1 and PATTERN2 are cell-arrays of strings.

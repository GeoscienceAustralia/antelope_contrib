DBGROUP Group a sorted table

DBPTR = DBGROUP ( DBPTR, GROUPFIELDS [,TYPE] )

DBGROUP clusters the rows of an input view into groups, each of which
has the same values for the fields specified in GROUPFIELDS. The input
table must be sorted by the GROUPFIELDS for this to work properly. Two
new columns are added to the output view: bundle and bundletype.  The
bundle is a database pointer specifying a continuous range of rows in
the input table. The bundletype is an integer field which is filled in
with the TYPE argument to DBGROUP. TYPE defaults to 1 if not
specified.

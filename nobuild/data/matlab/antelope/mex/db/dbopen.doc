DBOPEN	Open a Datascope database

DBPTR = DBOPEN ( FILENAME, OPENTYPE )

DBOPEN opens the database specified by the path name
FILENAME,  using the  permissions given by opentype.  A
database pointer with the database index filled in is
returned in DBPTR. The opentype may be either r (for  read
only)  or  r+  (for reading  and  writing).   In the latter
case, the db package will attempt to open tables
read/write, but  if  permissions are incorrect, will open
the table read only.

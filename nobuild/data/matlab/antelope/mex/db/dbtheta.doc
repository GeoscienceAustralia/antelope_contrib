DBTHETA	Theta join two Datascope database tables

DBPTR = DBTHETA ( DBPTR1, DBPTR2 [, EXPRESSION ] [, 'outer'] )

DBTHETA joins two  database  tables DBPTR1 and DBPTR2.
Each  record  in  the result  table must satisfy the
specified EXPRESSION. If EXPRESSION is omitted, 
the result table  has  one  record for every combination
of the records from the two tables. If the 'outer' keyword
is specified, DBTHETA performs an outer join.

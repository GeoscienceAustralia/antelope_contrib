DBDELETE Delete the specified record in a Datascope database

DBDELETE ( DBPTR )

DBDELETE immediately deletes a row from a Datascope
database, pointed to by DBPTR. When immediate deletion is
undesirable (say when further processing on the database
may rely on current indices), use DBMARK and DBCRUNCH
instead.

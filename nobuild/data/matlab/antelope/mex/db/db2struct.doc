DB2STRUCT Convert a database view to a Matlab structure array

S = DB2STRUCT ( DBPTR [, FIELD [, FIELD, ... ]] )

DB2STRUCT is an experimental interface that reads values from
fields in the database pointed to by DBPTR into a Matlab structure array. 
The DBPTR must be a single table or a view on a single table. Multiple-
table views are not supported because of difficulties in structure-field
naming conventions. If one or more optional FIELD names are specified,
the structures are limited to the fields requested.

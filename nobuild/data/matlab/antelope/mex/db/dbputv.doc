DBPUTV Put the specified values into a Datascope database

DBPUTV ( DBPTR, FIELD, VALUE [,FIELD, VALUE ... ] )

DBPUTV may be used to read and  write  values  to and
from  fields  in a database table.  The values are con-
verted between the ascii representation and  double  or
int for  floating  point  or  integer  fields.  Character
string fields are stripped of leading and trailing
blanks,  and  a null  is appended when they are read; when
they are written, they are (silently) truncated or padded
with blanks  to  the correct length.

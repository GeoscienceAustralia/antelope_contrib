DBPROCESS Construct a Datascope database view as a series of operations

DBPTR = DBPROCESS ( DBPTR, STATEMENT_LIST )

DBPROCESS provides a simplified interface for forming various views.
Input to dbprocess is a cell-array of strings STATEMENT_LIST, which 
are performed in order, creating a view. For a full discussion of valid 
statements, see the Unix man-page on the Antelope dbprocess command. In 
brief, they are:

	dbopen table
	dbjoin [-o] table [ key key  ..]
	dbgroup key [ key  ..]
	dbleftjoin [-o] table [ key key  ..]
	dbnojoin table [ key key  ..]
	dbselect expr [expr ...]
	dbseparate table
	dbsever table
	dbsort [-ru] key .. ]
	dbsubset expression
	dbtheta table [ expression ..]
	dbungroup

Here is an example of how to create a cell array of strings:

db = dbprocess( db, { 'dbopen arrival'; 
                      'dbsubset sta == "AAK"'; 
                      'dbjoin assoc' } );

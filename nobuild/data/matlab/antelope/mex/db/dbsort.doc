DBSORT Sort the specified Datascope database table

DBPTR = DBSORT ( DBPTR [,FIELD, FIELD,...] )

DBSORT creates a new view of the database table specified
by DBPTR, sorted by the fields specified in the argument
list.  if no fields are specified, the table is sorted by
its primary keys. If one of the arguments is 
'dbSORT_REVERSE', the sort is performed in reverse order. 
If one of the arguments is 'dbSORT_UNIQUE', then rows
which have duplicate sort keys are eliminated.

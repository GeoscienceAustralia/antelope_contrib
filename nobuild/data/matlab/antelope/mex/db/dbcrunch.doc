DBCRUNCH Crunch out null fields in a Datascope database table

DBCRUNCH ( DBPTR )

DBCRUNCH searches database tables  for  records  which  are
null,  and  removes them.  While a program is operating on
a database, it is usually better to "mark" records  for
dele- tion,  by setting them to all nulls, rather than
immediately deleting them.  Immediate deletion changes the
record number of  all  succeeding  records, invalidating
views and indexes based on that table, as well as any
counters which the  program may be keeping itself.

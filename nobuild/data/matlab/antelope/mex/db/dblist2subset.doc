DBLIST2SUBSET 

DBPTR = DBLIST2SUBSET ( DBPTR [, LIST] )

DBLIST2SUBSET takes a database view, specified with the database pointer DBPTR,
and creates a subset from it based on a LIST of input row numbers. The LIST
should be a Matlab matrix (usually a 1xn vector) of integers listing the row 
numbers the user wants to include in the new subset view. If the LIST argument 
is omitted, DBLIST2SUBSET assumes the input DBPTR is a grouped view (for example, 
one created by the DBGROUP command), and converts the group to its own official subset.

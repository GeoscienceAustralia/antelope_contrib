DBUNJOIN Unjoin the specified database table, writing to new database

DBUNJOIN ( DBPTR, OUTPUT )

DBUNJOIN finds all the rows in the base tables which make
up a  particular view, and writes them to a new set of
database tables.  By creating a subset of some table in
the  original database,  then joining this subset to
several other tables, and then using DBUNJOIN to create a
new  database,  you  can effectively create a subsetted
database.  DBPTR points to the input view. OUTPUT is the
filename of the output database.

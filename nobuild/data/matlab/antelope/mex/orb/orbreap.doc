ORBREAP Get successive packets from an Antelope ORB connection

[RESULT, TIME, SRCNAME, PKTID, TYPE] = ORBREAP ( ORBFD [, 'nodelay'] )

ORBREAP gets successive packets (one at a time) from the Antelope ORB
connection specified by ORBFD. For a full description of the 
input and output arguments see the documentation on ORBGET. The difference
between ORBREAP and ORBGET is that ORBREAP is at the mercy of any 
previous ORBSEEK or ORBAFTER command for its starting point 
in the packet reading. ORBREAP is intended to be called in a 
tight loop, as opposed to the hunt-and-peck packet retrieval of ORBGET. 
The default behaviour of ORBREAP is to block until it receives the next
packet. If this is not desired, use the 'nodelay' option. In the 'nodelay'
case ORBREAP will return immediately (but without setting any of its
return values) if no packet is available.

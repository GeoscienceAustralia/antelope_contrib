ORBOPEN	Open a connection to an Antelope object-ring-buffer

ORBFD = ORBOPEN ( ORBNAME, OPENTYPE )

ORBOPEN connects to the orbserver specified by ORBNAME,
which is usually an ip address, or ipaddress:port. OPENTYPE
is one of 'r', 'w', 'r&', 'w&', where the ampersand
suffixes cause the library to attempt automatic
reconnection if the socket connection is severed.
ORBFD is a file-descriptor returned by the command. This is used
in other commands to communicate with the orb.

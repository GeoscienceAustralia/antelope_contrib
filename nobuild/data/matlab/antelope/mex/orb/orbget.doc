ORBGET Get packets from an Antelope ORB connection

[RESULT, TIME, SRCNAME, PKTID, TYPE] = ORBGET ( ORBFD [, CODE **or** PKTID] )

ORBGET gets a packet from the Antelope ORB connection specified by 
ORBFD. The connection must be opened (i.e. ORBFD must be obtained) first 
with the ORBOPEN command. The packet retrieved is from the current read
position of the ORB connection (see ORBSEEK and ORBAFTER). An optional packet-id
may be specified as PKTID, in which case ORBGET will return that packet. 
Alternatively, the same CODEs as used in ORBSEEK (such as 'ORBNEXT' etc.)
may be used to specify the read position. The returned RESULT will be a
database pointer for database-row packets; a trace-object database 
pointer for waveform packets; a DBPF parameter-file object for 
parameter-file packets; and a raw byte array for other types of packets. 
the TYPE field will be, respectively, 'database', 'waveform','parameterfile',
or 'unknown'. The TIME field specifies the timestamp of the packet in 
epoch seconds. The SRCNAME field gives the source-name string labelling 
the packet. Finally, PKTID gives the packet-id of the returned packet.
For looping continuously to retrieve packets, consider using ORBREAP.

PFTYPE Find the type of a parameter-file object

TYPESTRING = PFTYPE ( DBPF )

PFTYPE takes an Antelope parameter-file object and returns
the type of the object, usually 'PFFILE' or 'PFARR' (other
types such as 'PFSTRING' and 'PFTBL' are automatically
internally converted to native Matlab datatypes).

PFNAME Find the name of a parameter-file object

NAME = PFNAME ( DBPF )

PFTYPE takes an Antelope parameter-file object of type
'PFFILE' (i.e. the type initially returned by the DBPF
constructor upon opening a parameter file or parameter-file
cascade) and returns the name which was passed to DBPF.
This command does not work on subsidiary parameter-file
types such as type 'PFARR', because there are situations in
which one can create a 'PFARR' type parameter file object
that does not have a name.

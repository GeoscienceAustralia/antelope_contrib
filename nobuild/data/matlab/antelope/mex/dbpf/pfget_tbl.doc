PFGET_TBL Get an ordered list from a parameter-file object

LIST = PFGET_TBL ( DBPF, NAME [, 'recursive' ] )

PFGET_TBL takes an Antelope parameter-file object and
extracts the named Tbl (ordered list) from it into a Matlab
cell array of strings. If the 'recursive' argument is
given, PFGET_TBL will try to recursively descend through
any array objects it encounters.

DBPF Dbpf (Parameter File) class constructor

PF = DBPF ( ) **or** DBPF ( PFNAME ) **or** DBPF ( PF, STRING )

DBPF creates a parameter-file object PF by reading the
parameter file specified by PFNAME. DBPF takes the basename
of the PFNAME argument, appends '.pf', then searches for
files along the environment-variable path PFPATH. If this
is not set, the DBPF constructor searches in
$ANTELOPE/data/pf, then in the current working directory.
If no argument is specified, DBPF creates a new
parameter-file object which can be filled in with values
using the pfput series of commands.  If two arguments are
specified, the first another parameter file object and the
second a string value, the STRING is compiled into the
parameter-file object PF and the new parameter-file object
is returned (for the converse utility see the pf2string
command).

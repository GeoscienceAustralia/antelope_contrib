PFRESOLVE Get an entry from a parameter-file object

RESULT = PFRESOLVE ( DBPF, NAME [, 'recursive' ] )

PFRESOLVE takes an Antelope parameter-file object and
extracts the named parameter from it. The RESULT will be
either an ordered list (returned as a cell array); an
associative array (returned as another DBPF object); a string; or 
a numeric value. PFRESOLVE will attempt to infer whether a value
can be represented numerically, and if so will return the parameter
as a numeric value. The naming convention used by PFRESOLVE
is different than that in the other DBPF routines.  Array
fields may be specified with curly braces, and Table items
may be specified with square-bracket indices.  If the
'recursive' argument is included, PFRESOLVE will attempt to
recursively descend through any array objects it
encounters.

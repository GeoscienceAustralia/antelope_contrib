PFUPDATE Dbpf (Parameter File) update utility

[PF, MODIFIED] = PFUPDATE ( PF )

PFUPDATE may be called repeatedly for a parameter file which
is  sometimes  updated;  if  any  of the component parameter
files (along PFPATH) have changed since the last update, the
entire sequence is reread and PFUPDATE sets the value of 
MODIFIED to 1. If nothing has changed in the parameter file, 
MODIFIED is set to 0. The input argument to PFUPDATE is an 
already-open parameter-file object. Only top-level parameter-file
object (those corresponding to an entire, open parameter file, not 
just a subsection such as a contained array) are allowed.

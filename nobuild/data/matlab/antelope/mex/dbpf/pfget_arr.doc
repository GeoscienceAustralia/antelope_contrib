PFGET_ARR Get an associative array from a parameter-file object

MYPF = PFGET_ARR ( DBPF, NAME [, 'recursive' ] )

PFGET_ARR takes an Antelope parameter-file object and
extracts the named Associative array from it into another
DBPF object of type 'PFARR'. If the 'recursive' argument is
specified, PFGET_ARR will try to recursively descend
through any array objects it encounters.

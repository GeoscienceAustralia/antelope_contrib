PF2STRUCT Convert a parameter file object to a structure

MYSTRUCT = PF2STRUCT ( DBPF [, 'recursive' ] )

PF2STRUCT takes an Antelope parameter-file object and
converts it to a Matlab structure. Each parameter name in
the parameter file becomes a field name in the structure.
The Antelope parameter-file library is more tolerant of
crazy names for parameters (such as names that include '.'
or '#') than the Matlab structure-field naming conventions.
If such a nonstandard parameter name is encountered,
PF2STRUCT will complain and fail.  In this case, the other
interfaces to the parameter file library must be used, such
as PFGET etc. If the 'recursive' argument is specified,
PF2STRUCT will attempt to recursively descend through any
array objects it encounters.

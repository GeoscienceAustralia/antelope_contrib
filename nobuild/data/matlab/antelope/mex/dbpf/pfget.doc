PFGET Get an entry from a parameter-file object

RESULT = PFGET ( DBPF, NAME [, 'recursive' ] )

PFGET takes an Antelope parameter-file object and extracts
the named parameter from it. The RESULT will be either an
ordered list (returned as a cell array); an associative
array (returned as another DBPF object); a string; or a numeric value. 
PFGET will attempt to infer whether a value can be represented 
numerically, and if so will return the parameter as a numeric value.
If the 'recursive' argument is included, PFGET
will attempt to recursively descend through any array
objects it encounters.

YEARDAY	Convert an epoch time to a yearday value

YEARDAY = YEARDAY ( EPOCH )

YEARDAY converts the epoch-time EPOCH to an integer value
of the form YYYYDOY, where YYYY is the year and DOY is the
day-number of the year. If EPOCH is a matrix of epoch
times, the return value will be a matrix of yeardays.

DBRESPONSE/PARSE_RESPONSE Dbresponse parsing routine

RESPONSE = PARSE_RESPONSE ( DBRESPONSE )

PARSE_RESPONSE takes a DBRESPONSE object and expands it into 
a cell array containing all the parts of the response. This 
routine is intended for specialized applications that need to
build their own response structures from scratch, based on 
existing components. Each cell of the returned cell array contains 
a structure with one stage of the response. These stages 
can be of different types (fap, paz, iir, fir, fap2), thus the 
structure elements will be different depending on the type of stage. 
All structures contain an element called 'type' which is a string 
containing one of 'fap', 'fap2', 'paz', 'iir', or 'fir'. The field
names for each of these individual structure types should be self-explanatory, 
given knowledge of that filter type.

TR2STRUCT Make exportable structure of waveform data from a trace object

S = TR2STRUCT( TR )

TR2STRUCT(TR) takes a Datascope trace-object and converts it to a
Matlab structure for export. The trace- object table is a structure
created by the DB2STRUCT command, with the exception that the 'data'
field is replaced by the actual time-series of the data using the
TREXTRACT_DATA command. Several other fields are added:  strtime is the
STRTIME command applied to the time field, and strendtime is the
STRTIME command applied to the endtime field.  Note that some fields
may be null values, depending on how the input trace-object was
generated (usually with the TRLOAD_CSS command; note that that command
can't add values to the trace object if they're not in the input
view!).

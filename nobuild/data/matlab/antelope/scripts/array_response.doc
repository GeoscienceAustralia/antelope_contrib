ARRAY_RESPONSE Response of a sensor array

z = ARRAY_RESPONSE(stations, points, range, frequency)
z = ARRAY_RESPONSE(database_name, array_name, points, range, frequency)
 
Calculates gains for a two-dimensional sensor array when excited by plane
waves of a given FREQUENCY over a range of horizontal slowness values.  
Gain is evaluated for POINTS slowness values ranging from -RANGE to +RANGE
in both the horizontal and vertical directions, yielding a POINTS*POINTS
matrix of gain values.  

The parameter STATIONS is a matrix giving the positions of the array
stations, one station per row. The first column is the east distance from
the array reference station, the second column is the north distance from
the array reference station.  Alternatively, in the second form of the 
parameter list, the stations corresponding to the given ARRAY_NAME will be 
looked up in the Datascope database DATABASE_NAME.

Example: Display the response of an array consisting of stations at (1,0),
(0,1), (1,1), over the range of slowness values from (-0.4 s/km, -0.4
s/km) to (0.4 s/km, 0.4 s/km) for plane waves at 5 Hz, with 100 sample
points on each axis:
 
 stations = [1 0; 0 1; 1 1]  
 response = array_response(stations, 100, 0.4, 5); 
 contour(response);  % display the results

Example: Compute the response of the Indian Mountain (IM) array, whose 
station locations are contained in the database 'master_stations':

  response = array_response('/databases/master_stations', 'IM', 100, 0.4, 5);

This file describes some issues related to the permutation of this library
for installation without the antelope package.   All users of this library
should recognize that the original library was very antelope centric.   It
became necessary to produce a variant of the library to run on high performance
systems where antelope installation was problematic in many cases.   In addition
I produced this for colleagues in Europe where obtaining a license for antelope
was not realistic due to the cost.  (Pretty much all US universities have 
easy access to antelope through an iris licensing arrangment.)

When this library is part of antelope it should simply build using the standard
make procedures.  

When the library is used without antelope support there are several issues:
1.  To build this library without antelope support use 
make -f Makefile.nodb
This removes some files from the compilation and sets a preprocessor macro
for conditional no compilation.
2.  This library is intimately linked with another called libgclgrid.   
That library can and should be built with the Makefile.nodb file.
3.  A limited set of the antelope API C functions were translated from the 
original Datascope library that formed the original kernel of Antelope.   
These are expected to be placed in a static library called libdsap.a 
4.  This and libgclgrid depend upon the file swapdvec, which references 
a newer set of byte swap routines that post date the old Datascope package.
A replacement for the routines called by this procedure are contained in 
the libdsap.a library.  Note antelope has a much more complete set of 
byte swap routines than I implemented here.   I handle only IEEE doubles.

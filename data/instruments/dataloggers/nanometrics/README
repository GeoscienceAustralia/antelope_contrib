Due to the complexity of the Taurus datalogger configuration, 
the various configs result in a long filename.  Unfortunately 
this produces non-unique filenames when dbbuild builds the 
combined sensor+datalogger response.  The solution is to 
include a number near the beginning of the filename to provide 
the uniqueness when the filename becomes truncated.  The list 
below indicates the numbering order and filename for the 
creation of additional taurus datalogger files.

An impedance of 43.07 k-ohms is "lo" or "std".
An impedance of 9.4 M-ohms is "hi" or "inf".
A 1 mHz IIR filter is "iir0_001".
A 1 Hz IIR filter (not shown) would be "iir1_000".

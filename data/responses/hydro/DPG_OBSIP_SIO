# Differential Pressure Gauge for OBSIP
# Using measurements from strain gauge full scale
# outputs, the average is about 57 mv/7e3 PA. According
# to Cox et al there is a mechanical attenuation
# factor due to the compressibility of the oil and the
# compliance of the chamber. They estimate this as 0.86.
# Willoughby et al say they measured the
# response and deduced this factor as 0.924.
# I suggest we use 0.9 until we can determine a better value.
# Thus the STAGE 1 gain should be 5.7e-2*0.9/7e3 or:
# S(DPG) = 7.3 Î¼V/Pa
# Normalized  response relative to pressure
# All poles and zeroes in radians/sec
# 1                   type
# 1                   num of zeroes
# 1                   num of poles
# 0.0                 input sample interval
# 1                   decim factor
# 828.26383492        normalization factor
# 1.0                 gain

# See Taurus User Guide, Appendix D.
# The poles used are the ones calculated by IRIS DMC for the Taurus.
#
# Use the low impedance setting to match the datalogger to a passive 
# seismometer. Passive seismometers have varying output impedance. 
# For example, an S13 may have an output impedance of 3085 ohms (Z).
# R = 9600 + Z = 12685 ohms
# C = 1.0E-8 farads
# pole(for use with an S13) = -1/RC = -7883.3
#
# The pole below was calculated by IRIS using Z=50 ohms, a conservative
# estimate for the roll-off.  In practice, one would have to sample at 
# over 2000sps for roll-off at the corner frequency of 2132 to have any effect
# (due to log frequency scale, the roll-off would start around 1000 Hz).
# So the fact that Z=50 may not be a realistic value for a passive
# seismo will not have an effect on the instrument response for the sample
# rates available with the Taurus (max sps = 500 sps).  It was felt that 
# these poles should be in keeping with those used by IRIS to avoid confusion.

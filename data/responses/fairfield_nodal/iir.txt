Frank,

" The DC Blocking filter is an IIR digital filter having one Zero at 1 + j0 and one Pole at (1 - 6.25*fc/SPS) + j0, where fc = corner frequency in Hz and SPS is the Sampling frequency. For example, for 500 samples/sec and 3 Hz corner frequency, The pole is (1-6.25*3/500) + j0 = .9625 + j0."
